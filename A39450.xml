         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PROJECT OF Conditions of Peace.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Is Majeſties inviolable fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in adhering to his Alliances, hath induced him never to liſten to any Propoſals of Peace, other than ſuch as ſhall give a full and perfect ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the King of <hi>Sueden:</hi> which likewiſe having been abſolutely promiſed to his Majeſty by the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> who was earneſt to gain this point, both for him and for the <hi>States General;</hi> he now likewiſe makes it the firſt Article that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts upon, and without which he cannot come to any concluſion upon the reſt.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Intereſt of the Duke of <hi>Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torp</hi> is ſo united to that of <hi>Sueden,</hi> that it makes a part of the Treaty of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> for the performance of which, his Majeſty gave his Garranty
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96323:8"/> to that Crown; his Majeſty deſires, that he may now likewiſe be comprehended within this Treaty, upon ſuch terms as ſhall be ſatisfactory to himſelf.</p>
            <p>As for the Prince and Biſhop of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> the King doth preciſely inſiſt upon the reſtitution of that Prince, and of all his Family, to all their Eſtates, Goods Honours, and Prerogatives; and particularly upon the reſtitution of his Brother Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Furſtemburg:</hi> whoſe Liberty muſt be provided for by one of the firſt Articles of the Peace.</p>
            <p>For what concerns the Empire, as his Majeſty doth ſtill continue in the ſame intention which he has expreſſed for its Peace, that he has been troubled to ſee it diſturbed; that it was with much trouble of mind he found himſelf compelled to carry the War thither; ſo he does yet adhere to theſe publick Declarations, which he has ſo often made, That he will inſiſt onely upon the reſtoring of the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> in all their points, and to have them once more to be the means of reſtoring Peace to <hi>Germany</hi> Which induces him to offer this Alternative to the Emperor; Either that the Emperor ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore <hi>Philipsburg,</hi> and have <hi>Friburg</hi> reſtored to him; or elſe keep <hi>Philipsburg,</hi> and let his Majeſty continue in poſſeſſion of <hi>Friburg,</hi> without making any the leaſt alteration in the other matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſaid Treaties.</p>
            <p>As for what concerns <hi>Spain,</hi> ſince its Intereſt appears to be the moſt conſiderable in this War, and both <hi>England, Holland,</hi> and ſome Eſtates bordering upon <hi>Flanders</hi> have further expreſs'd their deſire, that that Crown ſhould retain ſuch a Frontier in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> as might be able to make that a Bar, which they judge is ſo very important to their ſafety; his Majeſty has
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96323:8"/> been pleaſed, at the inſtance of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> to agree to the means for the ſetling it. And upon this conſideration it is, as his Majeſty declared himſelf to that Prince, that he has offered already, and doth yet offer to reſtore to <hi>Spain</hi> thoſe following Places, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Place of <hi>Charleroy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Limburg,</hi> and its Appurtenances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Binch,</hi> and the Provoſtſhip thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aeth,</hi> and its Chaſtellany.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oudenard,</hi> and its Chaſtellany there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Courtray,</hi> and its Chaſtellany; the Verge of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin</hi> onely excepted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gand,</hi> and its dependances.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Guillain;</hi> but with its Fortifications raſed.</p>
            <p>For ſo many Places of importance, and which his Majeſty has taken ſo much care, and been at ſo great expence to Fortifie; he requires in exchange, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> quit his right to thoſe Places which his Majeſty hath poſſeſſed himſelf of in this laſt War.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Franche Compte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> and its Dependances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bouchain,</hi> and its Dependances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conde,</hi> and its Dependances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cambray</hi> and <hi>Cambreſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Air,</hi> St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and their Dependances.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Ipre,</hi> and its Chaſtellany.</p>
            <p>The Places of <hi>Werwick</hi> and <hi>Werneton,</hi> on the River <hi>Lis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bavay</hi> and <hi>Maubeage,</hi> with their Dependancies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poperingue, Bailleul,</hi> and <hi>Caſſel,</hi> with their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances.</p>
            <p>In a word, that he quit his Right to all ſuch Places and Countreys as his Majeſty hath now in his poſſeſſion; excepting thoſe before mentioned,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96323:9"/> which his Majeſty is willing to reſtore to <hi>Spain;</hi> The Town of <hi>Charlemont,</hi> or in lieu thereof, the Towns of <hi>Dinant</hi> and <hi>Bouvines;</hi> upon condition that he, at the choice of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> will charge himſelf, that the Biſhop of <hi>Liege</hi> ſhall quit his right to <hi>Dinant,</hi> and that the Emperor and Empire ſhall give their aſſent thereunto. By this means the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Frontier in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> would for the future begin from the Sea, to the <hi>Meuſe, Newport, Dixmude, Courtray, Oudenard, Aeth, Mons, Charleroy,</hi> and <hi>Namur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Articles which concern the <hi>States General,</hi> they are ſo very favourable, that they cannot but conclude, that his Majeſty doth fully purpoſe to receive them into the former Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, after the Peace ſhall be concluded. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty is willing to reſtore them <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and to agree to the Treaty of Commerce, in ſuch form as it was framed at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> with the Sieur <hi>Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to the end his Majeſty may give the World the utmoſt teſtimony of his ſincere intentions for the Peace, his Majeſty, notwithſtanding any reaſon that might induce him to continue in poſſeſſion of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> is willing that Prince <hi>Charles</hi> be reſtored to it, upon one of theſe two Alternatives, of which he gives him his choice.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That he be reſtored according to the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles expreſſed in the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Treaty, without any change or alteration in any of them.</p>
            <p>Or ſecondly, That he be reſtored generally to his whole Eſtate, except the Town of <hi>Nancy,</hi> which his Majeſty will retain, with plenary Right of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, and excepting ſuch a way as was agreed upon at the Treaty of 1661. to paſs from the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96323:9"/> of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> and all ſuch ways as ſhall be neceſſary to paſs from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Nancy;</hi> and from <hi>Nancy</hi> to <hi>Metz, Briſac,</hi> and <hi>Franche Compte;</hi> upon condition nevertheleſs, that to make him ſome compenſation for the Town of <hi>Nancy,</hi> his Majeſty ſhall reſign to him that of <hi>Toul,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable for its extent and ſituation, and much more in reſpect of its Biſhoprick.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty demands likewiſe, that <hi>Long-Wic</hi> and its Provoſtſhip be quitted to him: but offereth withall to recompenſe the Prince of <hi>Lorrain</hi> with another provoſtſhip of equal value within one of the three Biſhopricks. And whereas <hi>Marſal</hi> having been quitted to his Majeſty by a particular Treaty, is not at preſent any part of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> ſo it is not to be underſtood to be compriſed in this reſtitution.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Terms which may, and ought to make the Platform of a General Peace, and upon which his Majeſty hath long ago declared himſelf to the King of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> His Majeſty deſires that they may be imparted to the Aſſembly at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen;</hi> and that his own Plenipotentiaries there propoſe them to the conſideration of the reſt, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the loweſt Conditions that he can admit; and upon which his Enemies may make choice either of War or Peace.</p>

            <p>Moſt dear great Friends, Allies, and Confederates,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>OUt of the ſincere affection which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways born to the promoting of the Peace of</hi> Europe, <hi>we are very much ſatisfi'd to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, by our Plenipotentiaries at</hi> Nimeguen, <hi>the account given unto them in your name, by one of your Ambaſſadors, concerning your thoughts upon the concluſion of ſo great a Work, which you had imparted to them by one of your Ambaſſadors. We are glad to underſtand, that the terms which we propoſed at that Aſſembly appear to you to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and that you are fully perſwaded of the ſincerity of our mind, in a matter of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: And it is with the greater fatisſaction to our ſelves, that we confirm the ſame unto you by this Letter; becauſe notwithſtanding thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which we have already acquir'd by our Arms, and may juſtly hope for by the proſecution of the War; yet we place our chiefeſt glory in making all the ſteps we can towards a Peace. But becauſe it appears by the Diſcourſes that have been made to our Plenipotentiaries by your order, that how deſirous ſoever you are to conclude the Peace, yet there remains ſome ſcruple with you concerning the Seventh Article of the Treaty of Commerce, which has been debated at</hi> Nimeguen <hi>between our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96323:10"/> and yours; and trouble of mind, leſt we ſhould make an entire Conqueſt of the</hi> Low-Countreys, <hi>in caſe</hi> Spain <hi>ſhould reject the Terms we have offered, we are willing to impart our thoughts unto you upon thoſe two Points. We cannot do it more favourably, as to the firſt of them, than by granting, that the Seventh Article ſhould be as your ſelves deſire it. And in taking ſuch meaſures with you upon the ſecond Point, as may eaſe you of the fear you expreſs for the loſs of</hi> Flanders. <hi>And this we will then do, when</hi> Spain <hi>having refuſed to conſent to the Peace, there ſhall be a Treaty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between us and you, upon ſuch Terms as have been already propos'd with relation to your ſelves, and that you ſhall have returned to our Alliance, and ſhall oblige your ſelves to continue Neuters during the War. We ſhall be always ready for your ſakes to grant to</hi> Spain <hi>the ſame Terms, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to</hi> Flanders, <hi>which they are at liberty now to accept: And we are further willing to aſſure you, that in all that time we will not Attaque any one Place in thoſe Provinces. Thus you ſhall always find us readily inclined, not onely to form that Bar which you think ſo neceſſary for your own ſafety, but to ſecure it; and to let you enjoy, together with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of Commerce, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other advantages you can expect from our Friendſhip. And if for the proſecuting this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation you ſhall think it neceſſary to ſend Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to us, they will find us near</hi> Ghent <hi>till the 27th. day of this Month, and in the ſame diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions we have declared to you in this Letter.

            <head>The Memorial which the King Ordered to be delivered to the Sieur <hi>Van Beverning,</hi> Ambaſſador Extraordinary from the States General of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> to his Majeſty.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THe King hath with pleaſure ſeen, as by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Heeren the States General, ſo by the Aſſurances which they have given him by the Heer</hi> Van Beverning, <hi>their Extraordinary Ambaſſador, that their Intentions to a General Peace, correſpond with the deſire his Majeſty hath had to procure the ſame, and that they are ready to accept the</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:96323:12"/> 
               <hi>Conditions which his Majeſty hath offered them by his Ambaſſadors and Plenipotentaries at</hi> Nimeguen. <hi>But at the ſame time that the Heer</hi> Van Beverning <hi>hath thus made known to him the Sentiments of the ſaid States General, he hath in their Name prayed his Majeſty would grant a Ceſſation of Arms for ſix Weeks, and hath repreſented to him, that they had need of that time, to communicate with their Allies, and to obtain their conſent for the conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſo great a work. The condition in which his Majeſties Arms are at preſent, and the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable opportunity that would be loſt in deferring their acting, would not permit him to conſent to this Propoſal, if the deſire to give Peace to</hi> Europe, <hi>did not much more prevail in him, than that of enlarging his Frontiers by new Conqueſts. It is in this conſideration to contribute to the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he will agree, at the deſire of the ſaid States General, to a Ceſſation of Arms for ſix weeks, to begin the firſt day of the next month, ſuch an one as was ſtipulated between</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain <hi>in the year 1668. But foraſmuch as it would not be juſt, if the Enemies of His Majeſty ſhould let that time paſs fruitleſly, and that inſtead of its ſerving to advance the Peace, they ſhould make advanttge thereof, to avoid the effect of his Majeſties Arms, that he ſhould have loſt the advantageous conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture which is at preſent in his hand; His Majeſty deſires of the ſaid States General, that they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him in caſe, during the time of the ſaid Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Arms, they cannot bring their Allies to accept the conditions which he hath offered, They will not aſſiſt them directly or indirectly againſt him, or againſt his Allies, during the whole courſe of the War.

            <p>HIs Excellency having ſeen and conſidered this Memorial, and at the ſame time made parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reflection upon the former ones of the 8th. and the 14th. of <hi>May;</hi> though the States General of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> know very well, that the terms upon which the King of <hi>France</hi> has offered to make Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> are very hard; yet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the misfortune and extremities that the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> are expoſed to, and that their Hi. and Mi. (though otherwiſe ſo much concerned alſo in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of their preſervation) do yet find themſelves at preſent deprived of all means to effect it, their People not being in condition to carry on the War; and conſidering that in this Juncture of Affairs, nothing can be of ſo great importance, as the preſervation of that miſerable Remainder of <hi>Flanders,</hi> by ſtrict Alliances, which they perſuade us to accept of, and value. And whereas in the ſaid Memorial, the States General do repreſent their inſtances of, and deſire to admit of the ſaid Conditions, in order to the concluſion of a Peace; his Excellency being willing to ſecond them, as he hath done from the very firſt time that his Maſter entred into the War, which he undertook firſt for the preſervation of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates Eſtates of the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> and has ſince continued to aſſert the common Intereſt, is now likewiſe willing to comply with the deſire of the States General, and to admit of a Peace upon

               <hi>A Declaration on the behalf of the King of</hi> Denmark.</head>
            <p>THe Ambaſſador Extraordinary, and Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary of his Majeſty the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> at the Treaty of Peace held at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen;</hi> hath ſeen by the communication which the Deputies of the States General of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> have made to the Miniſters of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates at the <hi>Hague,</hi> what his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty was pleaſed to Order the delivery of in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Excellency the Sieur <hi>de Beverning</hi> their Ambaſſador Extraordinary, as well touching his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a Ceſſation of Arms for Six weeks, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his demand of a promiſe from the States General, that in caſe they ſhall not be able during that Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to prevail with their Allies to accept of ſuch Terms as his Majeſty hath offered, that then they will no longer Aſſiſt them directly or indirectly, againſt him or his Allies during the continuance of the War; And having thereupon conſidered what he conceives is fit and neceſſary for the Kind his Maſter to do upon occaſſion of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſties ſaid agreement and demand; He thinks it his duty to repreſent to their Excellencies, the Ambaſſadors Extraordinary, and Plenipotentiaries of the High Allies at this Congreſs, that preſuppoſing, which he does without any doubt, the conſtancy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the States General, wherewith they have always hitherto maintain'd the Credit and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Treaties, which is the true band and moſt proper ſupport of a free Common-wealth, That they will not do any thing that may caſt the leaſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96323:15"/> blemiſh upon the Reputation which they have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to honourably accquired and maintain'd, His Majeſty aſſures himſelf that in this juncture, they will not ſet one ſtep to the Prejudice of thoſe mutual engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are betwixt himſelf and them: in diſcharge of which he has vouchſafed to hazard his own ſacred Perſon, and the choiceſt blood of his Subjects, to the expence of what the utmoſt of the revenue of all his Kingdoms and Eſtates would amount to. Every one may remember into what extremity of Affairs his Majeſty was willing, when requeſted, to throw himſelf in the midſt of thoſe Calamities, that then oppreſſed the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and ſome of the Confederates, with intention to deliver them from the ruine that threatned them, and to take part with them in their moſt dangerous Events: What courſe he took to effect this, and the benefit which has accrewed by his Engaging in it, both to the common cauſe of all the Confederates, and to their Hi. and Mi. the States General of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> in particular, is ſufficiently known to all the World: ſo that it would be to no purpoſe to make a repetation of them here. A ſure and honourable Peace is what every one now aims at: For the obtaining whereof, if the mutual engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Confederates ſtand in one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, continue in force, we ought to Treat upon terms, and not take them ready made to our hands. It has been demonſtrated more then once by preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and undeniable Arguments and Reaſons, that a Ceſſation of Arms muſt needs come attended with many great miſchiefs and inconveniences: if there are more cogent Arguments why the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> in reſpect of their own Affairs in particular, and the concerns of ſuch
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96323:16"/> whoſe intereſt is the ſame with theirs, ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a Truce with <hi>France,</hi> we may well hope at leaſt that that conſideration will not be thought ſufficient to oblige others, whoſe Affairs are in quit different circumſtances, to come into the Truce likewiſe: And that they will ſo qualifie the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Truce, as that what makes for the advantage of one part of the Allies, may not be to the utter ruine of all the reſt; though the Arms of <hi>France</hi> are attended with a ſtrange current of Succeſs, yet the faithfulneſs of which the Moſt Chriſtian King makes profeſſion, in adhering to his Allies, ought not to triumph over their conſtancy, whom common intereſt has linked together in a ſacred bond for their mutual preſervation. This vertue will make them reſpected even among their enemies; whereas the contrary would blaſt all their Reputations, and lead them one by one into Calamities, which they would diſcover the cauſe of too late, when the effects would be remedileſs. His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty has given the States General a very ſhort time to declare themſelves upon the contents of his Memorial, the foreſight of his Councel ſaw very well, that the time would be too ſhort for all the parties concern'd to be well adviſed: and we may eaſily judge with what deſign the matter was ſo Ordered: But if we muſt take the things as they are, and make the beſt we can of them, we may certainly aſſure our ſelves that their Hi. and Mi. will not ſhorten the time, but will allow their Friends as large a Term as their Enemies have allowed them: and that they will not precipitate themſelves into ſuch reſolutions as the events that half a day may produce, may likely make them repent of their forwardneſs in taking up
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96323:16"/> But above all things his Majeſty aforementioned, and his ſaid Ambaſſador Extraordinary, in his name and on his behalf doth moſt earneſtly entreat their Excellencies the Ambaſſadors Extraordinary of their Highneſſes, that they will interpoſe to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their power, and make uſe of the credit that they have with the States General their Maſters, to prevent their putting themſelves out of all poſſibility of doing any thing for thoſe that have done all for them (which power our Enemies reſerved to themſelves, for the ſakes of ſuch as have not contributed at all or but very inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to the putting them into the condition in which now they are in) and that at leaſt they will continue a readineſs of mind to do what may be in their power, though they ſhould happen to be deſtitute of ſuch means as might enable them to do what they ought. Their Hi. and Mi. may be well aſſured that his Majeſty will never reject their Councel and Advice in any thing whatſoever that may be reaſonably thought to conduce to the publick Peace, in which if he could have any aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that he might find his ſecurity, he would immediately put an end to the War, and lay down his Arms as mildly, as he took them up generouſly, for the intereſt and at the requeſt of his Allies.</p>

But in the mean time he thinks himſelf obliged to ſay beforehand, that his Electoral Highneſs having always repoſed great confidence in the Sincerity, Integrity, and Juſtice of their Highneſſes, the States General of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96323:17"/> the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> as thoſe that have been his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Friends and Confederates, and whoſe intereſts are in many reſpects the ſame with his own, aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf that their Highneſſes will not make any promiſe to his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, that ſhall at all interfere with their Alliances, or be prejudicial to his Electoral Highneſs, who hath not ſpared his own Eſtates, nor his Blood, to ſave their Countrey from utter ruine and deſtruction, with which it was threatned when three whole Provinces were torn from it though ſince by God's great mercy they have been reunited. Beſides, his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Highneſs promiſeth himſelf that their Hi. and Mi. will be ſo reaſonable, ſince even his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty hath been willing to allow them the whole month of <hi>June</hi> to acquaint the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> with what they ſhall think fit to reſolve upon his ſaid Declaration, as not to anticipate the Term to the prejudice of his Electoral Highneſs, but will allow him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time for mature deliberation, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching of ſuch Order as ſhall be neceſſary to his Miniſters here and elſewhere. His Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs takes it likewiſe for granted, that their Hi. and Mi. will never come to a Treaty, much leſs conclude any thing whatſoever with <hi>France,</hi> without firſt procuring for his Electoral Highneſs the ſatisfaction promiſed him in the 14 and 24 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of their Alliance, and without reſerving the ſame Liberty to themſelves with relation to their Allies, which his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty might or ſhould reſerve in favour of his; Eſpecially ſince it is evident, that his Electoral Highneſs did not engage in this War out of an <hi>airineſs of mind,</hi> but for the ſafety of the Low Countreys, the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96323:18"/> preſervation of his own Eſtates, and to ſecure himſelf againſt the injuries and attempts of others, and that he hath not been more deſirous of any thing ſince the firſt beginning of this War, than of a firm and ſure Peace upon reaſonable Terms. And that he will always take in good part the good offices that ſhall be uſed to attain it, and that he will make appear as well his moderation with relation to the Terms and Conditions of it, as his due conſideration of the reaſons and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities alledged by their High and Mighty for a Peace. Provided things may be ſo ordered, that he may obtain his ends, which are no other than the ſafety of the publick, and that of his own Countrey.

There are ſo many inſtances in Hiſtories how dangerous the neighbourhood of <hi>France</hi> is, that it hath given occaſion to a Proverb. This the States themſelves have found by experience in this very War, when the Bar of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> was ſtronger. What will they do now that thoſe Bars are almoſt broken down, and they ſhall have ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as the <hi>French</hi> earneſtly preſs them to do, from the reſt of the Confederates? Then their ſafety muſt ſolely depend upon the ſincerity and moderation of the <hi>French.</hi> His Imperial Majeſty
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96323:19"/> undertook the War together with the reſt of the Confederates for their common ſafety, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Empire, and particularly that of theſe Provinces: he hath carried it on hitherto, not for his own private intereſt, but in ſuch place and manner as was thought beſt good for the publick: And he is yet willing, if the Confederates pleaſe, to continue it in conjunction with them, and will be ready to lay down his Arms, when that ſhall make more for the Common intereſt. And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhall make a Peace, he will have the ſame regard to the circumſtances of the <hi>United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and of all the <hi>Low Conntreys,</hi> which he has appeared hitherto to have had in the undortaking and carrying on the War.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> has propoſed ſome condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Peace, but in ſuch a manner as if he were giving Laws to us. He will not ſuffer us to Treat with him <hi>concerning them.</hi> Which to be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Emperor, the Empire and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, is not only inconſiſtent with their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Safety and Intereſt, contrary to the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing it ſelf. Beſides which no ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication at all is made in theſe conditions, what ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction it is in particular, the <hi>French</hi> would have ſtipulated in behalf of <hi>Sweden,</hi> ſo it is but too evident they are far from any intentions of Peace, ſince they will not ſo much as treat concerning it, according to thoſe Forms and Methods which are obſerved betwixt Soveraign Princes and Eſtates, and are grounded upon the Law of Nations. It is not a Peace that <hi>France</hi> aims at, but a diviſion amongſt the Confederates: that conqueſt may be the more eaſie, when he ſhall have to do with them apart: if there be any urgent reaſon or
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96323:19"/> neceſſity of making a Peace, the Emperor is willing to do it forthwith upon ſuch terms as will be neither dishonourable nor prejuaical to <hi>France,</hi> and manifeſt to the whole World his moderation, according to his High Function; and that although he has great regard to the ſafety of the Empire, yet that he prefers the common ſafety and the preſervation of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> and of all the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> before any particular intereſts of his own. This will be made apparent when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Peace ſhall be treated of, and the States General ſhall employ their offices for it, which will be always acceptable to his Imperial Majeſty, which being ſo, it cannot without injury to the conſtancy, prudence, and integrity of the States General be prefumed that they will upon any raſh reſolution abandon their moſt faithful Confederate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by expoſe them to manifeſt danger. They have Twenty days time yet before the end of this month to reſolve in. But all our intereſts, our common liberty, and the ſafety of all the Confederates is now at ſtake. The enemy endeavours to preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate their reſolutions, becauſe he is their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and would lead them to a precipice: the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates Council is to proceed ſafely and deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as being engaged in one and the ſame common cauſe with the States General, when once the Enemy ſhall obſerve that the States reſolve to Treat ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately, <hi>France</hi> will obtain what is deſired, the general Peace will be deſperate, which otherwiſe might have been expected, if all the Confederates would have made appear to the common Enemy their unanimous conſtancy and moderation. Let the States General therefore repreſent ſpeedily and ſeriouſly to the Ambaſſadors of his Moſt Chriſtian
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96323:20"/> Majeſty, that it is that they hinder the reſtoring of Peace to Chriſtendom, in that they deny the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates liberty to Treat about thoſe matters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there can be no Peace: the Ambaſſadors of his Imperial Majeſty do hereby oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to repreſent the whole matter that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and neceſſiries which induced the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to chuſe even a diſadvantageous Peace, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the continuance of the War, are not at all diſpleaſing to his Imperial Majeſty, who will be ready to comply therewith, and to concur with them as far as in him lies, to endeavour a Peace, ſo as the ſafety of the Empire be in ſome degree provided for; and that he will jointly conſult with the States General and the other Confederates, by what way and means the ſame may be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rendred ſecure.</p>
            <p>And as the Imperial Miniſters have thought it their duty to remonſtrate theſe things to the Ambaſſador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the High and Mighty Lords, the States General of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> ſo they do earneſtly beſeech and intreat them ſeriouſly to weigh of how great importance this matter is: and to ſupport it with their offices and recommendation, in which they will do a thing becoming themſelves, glorious and beneficial to their Countrey, deſired by the Confederates and every one elſe that loves the publick ſafety and ſecurity, and which will be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to poſterity, to their immortal praiſe and merit.</p>

            <p>IT was with an equal mixture of Joy and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that we underſtood by your Majeſties anſwer of the firſt of this inſtant, from your Camp at <hi>Wetteren,</hi> which the <hi>Sieur De Beverning</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us, the reality of your Majeſties intentions to put an end to the preſent war: to which end, your Majeſty was pleaſed to allow us all this month, to induce our Allies to accept the Peace upon the terms which your Majeſty hath propoſed: to which unfeigned purpoſe of your Majeſties, that we might anſwer with the like ſincerity on our parts, and give your Majeſty all the ſatisfaction we poſſibly could, we have left nothing undone to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our Allies to a complyance: and though we could not promiſe our ſelves that they would joyn with us in making a peace upon thoſe terms, yet we have given orders to our Ambaſſadors at <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi> to conclude and Sign the Treaty of Peace with your Majeſties Ambaſſadors and Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries, and ſuch of the Confederates as ſhould be diſpos'd to come into it before the end of this month. In the mean while, having ſome aſſurance that his Catholick Majeſty will joyn with us in accepting the Peace, we make it our requeſt that your Mejeſty will be pleaſed to give neceſſary orders to ſurceaſe all acts of hoſtility by Land, and to cauſe ſuch of your Mejeſties Forces as are in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

            <p>Moſt Dear, Great Friends, Allies, and Confederates,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You will eaſily judge, after all that we have done toward the Facilitating of a Peace, that we were very well ſatisfied to underſtand by</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:96323:21"/> 
               <hi>your Letter, that before the time which we had agreed to allow for a Ceſſation of Arms, you had ſent inſtructions to your Plenipotentiary Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor at</hi> Nemiguen, <hi>to Sign the Treaty of Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of this month. And by the aſſurance which you give us, that at the ſame time thoſe of the Catholick King will accept of it, we ſee your inclinations are well diſpoſed toward the general quiet of</hi> Europe. <hi>We Promiſe our ſelves likewiſe that it cannot be long retarded by thoſe of your Allies, that hitherto, notwithſtanding all the good Offices which you have done towards it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to joyn with you in the procuring ſo great a good and ſo univerſally deſired. In the mean time as the Peace, which we doubt not but will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately be concluded with you at</hi> Nimeguen, <hi>ſince we have your word for it, puts us into a condition of rendring you our entire affection, of which we take delight in letting you feel the effects, we are willing at your deſire from hence forward to ſurceaſe all acts of hoſtility to the</hi> Low Countreys, <hi>and whatever obſtruction our Men of War, or Privateers may give to your Commerce. Common uſage would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that things ſhould continue in the ſame poſture they now are, till the Peace were fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated by exchange of the Ratifications and publication of Treaties: but without ſtaying till they, that are now to be Signed betwixt our Plenipotentiaries Ambaſſadors at</hi> Nimeguen, <hi>thoſe of the Catholick King and yours, ſhall be come to our hands; out of our reſpect to you, we will ſend or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der immediately to the Duke of</hi> Luxemburg, <hi>to retire our Army from about</hi> Bruſſells <hi>into that part of the Country, that is now under our ſubjection.

The Treaty which Our Ambaſſadors muſt Sign with Yours, will aſcertain the Places and Times, within which what ever ſhall be taken on either ſide, ſhall be deemed lawful Prize. But for the preſent ſecurity of ſuch Veſſels as ſhall Sail out of your Ports, whether for Trade, or Fiſhing, we think good to ſend a competent number of Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to our Ambaſſadors at</hi> Nimeguen, <hi>whom we will order to deliver them to Yours, as there ſhall be occaſion. They ſhall do the ſame to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of</hi> Spain. <hi>But upon this condition, that when the Ambaſſador of the Catholick King and your Ambaſſador ſhall receive them, they ſhall be obliged at the ſame time to put into my Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors hands ſuch quantities of Paſsports as they ſhall demand of them.

            <p>THe Penſionary <hi>Fagel</hi> has ſhown to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a Letter of the <hi>10th</hi> of this inſtant, from the Ambaſſador Extraordinary, and Plenipotentiary at the Treaty of Peace at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> written to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, importing that the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> have declared to them, that the King their Maſter is not minded to Evacuate <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> nor the other places of the Bar, till a compleat ſatisfaction be made to the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> Where, upon deliberation, we have thought fit that this matter be put in as from the States aforeſaid to the States General, to the end that anſwer may be returned to the Ambaſſadors of the States: that it could not be believed nor expected that his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would have made the leaſt difficulty in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96323:23"/> Evacuation of thoſe places, after the Peace Signed, concluded and ratified betwixt his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty and <hi>Spain</hi> and this State: and that the States could not foreſee that there would ariſe any new obſtructions or difficulties on his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſti's part, after he had given them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and by his Miniſters ſo many aſſurances of his unfeigned inclinations not only to a general Peace, but particularly to a Peace with this State.</p>
            <p>It is very true, that when his Mejeſty compos'd a general platform for us to take our meaſures by, it was put down in the firſt Article, that his Majeſty would never liſten to any Terms of Peace, other than ſuch as ſhould give the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> full and compleat ſatisfaction: and his Majeſty might with good reaſon inſrſt upon it, and take care to have it effected, if we had been able to diſpoſe the Confederates to accept the conditions of that Project. But ſince the Confederates did not think it their intereſts to make Peace upon thoſe terms, as the States foreſaw at firſt they would not, and that his Catholick Majeſty would make ſome ſcruple, as the Ambaſſadors of the State intimated to thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> deſiring them to let them know what places the King their Maſter intended ſhould make the Bar in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands:</hi> and his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty was pleaſed to aſſure the States by a Letter of the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> written from his Camp, in caſe his Catholick Majeſty ſhould refuſe the Peace upon the ſaid Terms, and that the States would conclude their Treaty, and oblige themſelves to remain neuters, that then his Majeſty would always be willing to grant to <hi>Spain</hi> the conditions of the Project, and promiſed not to lay Siege to any place in the <hi>Spaniſh Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96323:24"/> ſatisfaction to the King of <hi>Sweden:</hi> that the States acting candidly, and being ready on their part to perfect that Treaty, and having induced his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty to accept it alſo, as they adviſed his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty by their Letter of the <hi>22th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> aſſuring him that they had given Order to their Ambaſſador, to conclude a Peace before the end of that month, with ſuch of the Confederates as would joyn with them in it, without ſo much as ſtaying for the Truee, which was to begin on the firſt of <hi>July;</hi> and that his Majeſty by his Letter of the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> declared himſelf to be extreamly well ſatisfied therewith: and was ſo far from obliging the States or his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to make any ſatisfaction to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> that he expreſſed in the ſame Letter, that he obſerv'd in the proceedings of the States a good inclination to the general Peace of <hi>Europe:</hi> and he perſwaded himſelf it would not be long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd by ſuch of the Allies as hitherto had not been able to help forward ſo great a good: that his Majeſty doubted not but the Peace would be concluded by his Ambaſſadors, and ſhould take delight in making this State ſenſible of its effects, and in forbearing all acts of hoſility in the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> and obſtructions to Commerce by Sea, though it be cuſtomary to let things continue in the ſame condition, till the Peace be Ratified by exchange of Ratifications, and publiſhing of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; without ſuspending the effects of the Peace upon any Treaty with the Confederates, or any ſatisfaction to be made to the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> That the States may ſay with good reaſon, that his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty is the cauſe why the Peace is not concluded, and not they: ſince his Majeſty
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96323:24"/> advances new Conditions, which never were propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to themſelves, nor to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> it never having been pretended, that the Peace, or its effects, ſhould depend upon the King of <hi>Sweden's</hi> receiving ſatisfaction, but onely upon the States ſtanding Neuter, in relation to his Majeſty and his Allies, againſt thoſe that ſhould reject the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Project. So that it is evident, that the moſt Chriſtian King hath promiſed to reſtore thoſe Places to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to this State; and that himſelf hath directed to have the Treaty perfected, by Exchanging the Ratifications, and publiſhing it: That the States pretend to no new matter concerning the ſaid Evacuation: That the things of no ſmall concern to the Catholick King, and to this State, who cannot arrive at peace and quiet, in getting rid of the War, if at the ſame time they continue depriv'd of the effects of Peace; much leſs if they muſt be ſent back, and made to depend upon the chances of War betwixt other Parties; which who knows when it will end in a ſatisfaction, that is not limited to any thing in particular? Eſpecially conſidering, that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> contimes an Enemy to this State, without giving order to put an end to the differences that are, and that daily grow betwixt him and it; and doth perpetually moleſt the Inhabitants of this State, contrary to the Treaty of Commerce made with him.</p>
            <p>That order be given to the Ambaſſadors and Plenipotentiaries of this State, to enquire of the Ambaſſadors of the moſt Chriſtian King, in a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and loving manner, without the leaſt ſharpneſs, whether the King their Maſter be reſolved to perſiſt in his demand, and to adviſe the Eſtates as ſoon as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96323:25"/> may be, that they may take proper meaſures, and conſer with the Miniſters of the Confederates, to know whether they can either come to a reſolution to accept the Peace upon the terms offered, or find means, if there ſhall be occaſion, to make a more vigorous oppoſition to their Enemies, than here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THe Ambaſſadors of</hi> France <hi>being troubled to ſee, that the difficulties ariſen concerning the time for the Evacuation of the places, which the King their Maſter is willing to reſtore, give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to thoſe that are averſe to the Peace, to render the ſincerity of his Majeſties intentions ſuſpected, have thought it their duty to manifeſt the ſame to the Ambaſſadors of the States General by this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to juſtifie the Reaſons his Majeſty hath, not to quit thoſe Places, until</hi> Sweden <hi>is entirely ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, it will be ſufficient to go no higher than the beginning of the Negotiation, by which the Peace is at preſent ſo far advanced. And we may ſay, that the ſame are grounded on the Conditions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in his Majeſties name by the ſaid Ambaſſadors of</hi> France, <hi>ſince they have been all of them accepted,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:96323:25"/> 
               <hi>firſt, by</hi> Holland, <hi>and not long after by</hi> Spain. <hi>We may farther ſay, that when the States General, in conſequence of the Letters his Majeſty writ unto them the</hi> 18th. <hi>of</hi> May <hi>laſt, and of the Memorial delivered the firſt of</hi> June <hi>to Monſieur</hi> de Beverning; <hi>as alſo of the meſſage of the Sieur</hi> de Lanoy <hi>to his Majeſty, and the Letter he preſented unto him on the part of the States, declared, they were ready to ſign the Treaty on thoſe Conditions, they obliged themſelves to the execution of that which relates to</hi> Sweden, <hi>it being the firſt of all of them. And as they were all joyned together, ſo they ought not to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in the meaning of the ſaid States General, to cauſe his Majeſty to conſent unto them; and he doubts not at all, that ſince he made but one thing of his own Intereſt and that of his Allies, their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not, but that he ſhould procure both the one and the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Majeſty had likewiſe reaſon to hope, that by advantaging both them and</hi> Spain, <hi>in being willing to quit ſo many important Places for the ſake of</hi> Sweden, <hi>they would have joyned with him to procure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of that Crown; and though his Majeſty hath not deſired them to unite their Forces to his, to put that Crown in poſſeſſion of the Places it hath loſt; yet they ought not to hinder him from making uſe of thoſe Means that are in his power, for the effectual executing of a Condition, to which they have ſo ſolemnly conſented. They know well, that his Majeſty hath no other effectual means, whereby to contribute to the re-eſtabliſhment of the King of</hi> Sweden <hi>in</hi> Pomerania <hi>and the Dutchy of</hi> Bremen, <hi>than by making War upon the Elector of</hi> Brandenburg, <hi>and the Princes that are poſſeſſed of the Eſtates of that Crown; and they know as well,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:96323:26"/> 
               <hi>that in order to his acting againſt thoſe Princes, his Majeſty will have occaſion for thoſe Places he now poſſeſſes, as being equally uſeful for the paſſage of his Armies, as for erecting Magazins there for them. Laſtly, they cannot look upon the Peace which his Majeſty is willing to make, otherwiſe than as one and the ſame Treaty, as well for himſelf as his Allies: nor think it ſtrange, if he take all neceſſary Cautions, to ſee all the Conditions of it performed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This practiſe is conformable to that of all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and for an example might be alledged the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of that of the</hi> Pyrenaeans, <hi>in which Treaty, the Places his Majeſty was to reſtore to the Catholick King, were evacuated proportionably as he on his ſide executed the Conditions he had agreed to; and</hi> Verceil, <hi>which the Catholick King was to ſurrender to the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>was reſtored in the ſame manner: for that the Intereſts of his Majeſty and his Ally were not to be ſeparated. In like manner, the States General being obliged to look upon as one and the ſame convention, the Conditions offered by his Majeſty, and accepted of by them at</hi> Nimeguen, <hi>they ought to do what lies in them, that the ſame be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted all together, as well with relation to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty as to</hi> Sweden.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And his Majeſty hath the greater reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they would concur with him in ſo juſt a thing, for that in the Project of the Treaty, which their Ambaſſador delivered to thoſe of</hi> France, <hi>there is no mention made therein of the time of the Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Places. This ſilence ſhows, that they did not pretend to it, till all the conditions that they had accepted ſhould be executed, and that therefore they would make the leſs difficulty, that</hi> Maeſtricht <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the hands of his Majeſty, in order to</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:96323:26"/> 
               <hi>oblige the Enemies of</hi> Sweden <hi>to Peace, for that the ſaid States General were by their Treaty to deliver that Place unto</hi> Spain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to evidence yet further to the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, how ſincerely his Majeſty intended, after the many paces he made to give Peace to</hi> Europe, <hi>to reſtore unto them his firſt Friendſhip, to promote the advantage they might receive from it, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from all future Enterpriſes upon the</hi> Low-Countreys; <hi>they need but reflect upon his Majeſties Conduct, ſince they declared by the Letter, which the Sieur</hi> de Lanoy <hi>delivered to his Majeſty, that they would ſign the Peace before the end of</hi> June, <hi>and that</hi> Spain <hi>would likewiſe ſign it at the ſame time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They may have obſerved, how at their entreaty, without expecting the Exchange of the Ratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, his Majeſty gave order to his Army to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the Neighbourhood of</hi> Bruſſels: <hi>How he was ready to open again the free Commerce and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, by the Paſsports he allowed his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to Exchange: How he offered to take mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with them about the manner how his Troops ſhould live near</hi> Mons, <hi>and about the means for the ſubſiſtance of that City, till the exchange of the Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications: How for the eaſe of the</hi> Low-Countreys, <hi>and the ſpeedy obliging the Elector of</hi> Brandenburg <hi>to conſent to the Peace, his Majeſty hath re-inforced the Mareſchal</hi> de Schomberg <hi>with a conſiderable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of his Army in</hi> Flanders, <hi>which he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cauſed to march into</hi> Germany, <hi>and was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point of ordering others to follow them. All which Conduct doth ſufficiently ſhow, that his Majeſty looking upon the Peace with</hi> Spain <hi>as certain, his intention onely was to employ his Forces</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:96323:27"/> 
               <hi>againſt the Elector of</hi> Brandenburg, <hi>thereby to oblige him to make his Peace with</hi> Sweden.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But becauſe his Majeſty obſerves, by the Reports which his Enemies ſpread abroad, that they endeavour to render the fidelity of his words ſuſpected, and would make it believed, That when by the Peace he had broken the meaſures of</hi> Spain <hi>and</hi> Holland <hi>for the War, he wouldmake uſe of the Places he ſhould retain, to act with more, advantage againſt the</hi> Low-Countreys; <hi>his Majeſty is very deſirous, as much as in him lieth, to cure them of theſe vain apprehenſions. The onely aim he has, in what he inſiſts upon, is to procure the ſatisfaction of</hi> Sweden; <hi>and he is willing to believe, that the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral have always the ſame intention; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ready to uſe all ſuch means, in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with them, as they ſhall think fit to be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to that end, either by obliging themſelves to reſtore that Crown to th Places and Countreys it has loſt, or by diſpoſing its Enemies to ſurrender them; provided they give his Majeſty full ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of its re-eſtabliſhment. His Majeſty will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly embrace ſuch Expedients as they ſhall propoſe unto him, and ſhall be eſteemed moſt ſpeedy and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to make the Peace General. And for the treating of this buſineſs, they may either diſcuſs it with the ſaid Ambaſſadors of</hi> France <hi>at</hi> Nimeguen, <hi>or appoint ſome Miniſter to repair to his Majeſty, or ſend Deputies to the Frontiers of</hi> Flanders <hi>and</hi> Ghent, <hi>as neareſt to their Countreys, to confer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon with thoſe to whom his Majeſty ſhall entruſt the care of it. His Majeſty will reſt ſatisfied, if they can but agree upon a ſafe, ſpeedy, and certain way of procuring the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of</hi> Sweden.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:96323:27"/>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſaid Ambaſſadors of</hi> France <hi>are perſwaded, that the ſaid Ambaſſadors of the States General, and all indifferent men, will be equally convinced, as well of the Right his Majeſty hath to demand the Execution of a Condition ſo poſitively accepted, as of procuring the ſame by ſuch means as are in his power, unleſs the States General ſhall adjuſt others with him, to obtain it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The long time his Majeſty hath loſt in</hi> Flanders <hi>ſince the 18th. of May, that he writ unto the ſaid States, doth alſo ſhew, how ſincerely he deſired the Peace. Conſidering the Condition in which his Majeſty and his Enemies then were, every body will eaſily believe, that onely the deſire of giving Peace to</hi> Europe, <hi>was capable of making him looſe ſo favourable a Conjuncture: And it is from the ſame deſire, that he is ſtill diſpoſed to admit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, that may ſecure the entire ſatisfaction of</hi> Sweden, <hi>and procure the Tranquility, which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom expects from this Aſſembly.</hi>

They ſtrongly poſſeſs themſelves with this perſwaaſion, that they cannot lay a more ſolid Baſis for their juſtification, than to give an ingenuous account of the beginning and progreſs of this Affair.</p>
            <p>Tis notorious, that the Lords the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral have done their utmoſt endeavours, without intermiſſion, to determine this preſent War by a General Peace, wherein all Parties Intereſted might have had that ſatisfaction which they have ſo paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately deſired, as might have diſpoſed all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatſoever thereunto. But ſuch was their misfortune, that the pretences of the other Allies being far different, and very far from it, and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty having cauſed his Ambaſſadors at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> to propoſe thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which might and ought to ſerve as a Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96323:28"/> to a general Peace; and upon that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, explaining himſelf, that it was the laſt point that he could poſſibly diſpence with; and hereupon his Enemies might make choice either of Peace or War, without being obliged, after the <hi>10th.</hi> of this preſent <hi>May.</hi> And the Lords the States General taking into their conſideration, that the major part of the ſaid propoſed Conditions, did concern their puiſſant Allies, did carefully explain themſelves, that they might find out ſome Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, and have endeavoured to diſpoſe of Affairs ſo, as that they might enter upon a Negotiation according to the ſaid Platform, to ſee what the Parties concerned at deſign'd but to their great regret, they have been inform'd, That it was not at all his Majeſties intention to cauſe a Treaty, or to admit any debate upon the Conditions propoſed; but that the Potent Parties, that were at War, ought ſimply to declare themſelves before the Term of the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> was expired, whether or no they would ſubſcribe the ſaid Conditions. Whereupon their Lordſhips have laboured continually with the Miniſters of their Allies, to underſtand their Sentiments. But they excuſing themſelves, upon the ſmall time allotted for this great Affair, and want of Order from their Maſters, wherewith they could not poſſibly be inſtructed before the Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the term; therefore their Highneſſes not being able to aſſure themſelves of the intentions of their powerful Allies, eſpecially the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in regard of the Acceptation or Refuſal of the ſaid Conditions: And conſidering, that the Stop propoſed by his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, muſt alſo give them particular ſatisfaction, have applied their farther endeavours to inform themſelves, how
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96323:29"/> this ſtop ſhould be conſidered, in caſe the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould refuſe to accept the ſaid Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and thereupon his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty hath been ſo kind as to honour them with a Letter written from his Camp. <hi>May</hi> the <hi>18th:</hi> and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them, that if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> denied to accept of the Peace, and they judged it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to conclude a Peace with him, on the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions propoſed upon their account, and that they would engage to remain Neuter, during the whole courſe of this War: His Majeſty in ſuch Caſes, would upon their conſideration, grant the ſaid King of <hi>Spain</hi> the ſame Conditions, which he was at liberty to accept of at this preſent, and that during that time, he would not attack any place in the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> and if my Lords the States General, in order to the advancement of this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, ſhould find it convenient to ſend Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to him, that they would find his Majeſty in the neighbourhood of <hi>Ghent,</hi> till the <hi>25th.</hi> of the ſaid month, and under the ſame diſpoſitions.</p>
            <p>Farthermore, the Lords of the States General, having declared before the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> to the Lords, Ambaſſadors of <hi>France;</hi> that for their parts they were reſolved to conclude a Peace with his Majeſty, upon the Conditions propoſed on their account, and having deſired a convenient time, to the end that they might diſpoſe their Allies to the ſame Peace, and after the Receipt of the aforeſaid Letter from his Majeſty, having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſend to him the Sieur <hi>Beverning,</hi> their Ambaſſador Extraordinary, to repreſent unto him, how earneſtly they deſired a general Peace, that they did accept of the Conditions offered, and that they deſired his Majeſty to grant them a Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96323:29"/> of Arms for Six weeks, that they might have time to diſcourſe with their Allies, upon the affairs of Peace, and to gain their conſent, for the concluſion of ſo great a Work. His Majeſty was Graciouſly pleas'd to declare by his anſwer the firſt of <hi>June,</hi> dated in his Camp at <hi>Wetteren,</hi> that he did condeſcend to that Ceſſation, for the ſpace of ſix weeks, as it was deſired, to commence from the firſt of <hi>July,</hi> and the ſame according to the ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain, Anno Dom.</hi> 1668. With this proviſo, they ſhould promiſe his Majeſty that in caſe, during the ſaid Ceſſation of Arms, they could not prevail with their Allies to accept of the Conditions offered, they would neither, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly nor indirectly aſſiſt them, againſt his Majeſty or his Allies, during the continuance of this War: And upon this conſideration his Majeſty was willing to Render by way of exchange, the ſame engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that he had obliged himſelf unto, with them, in his ſaid Letter of the <hi>18th.</hi> of <hi>May;</hi> as well in regard of the ſame Conditions, which he would be always inclinable to grant to <hi>Spain;</hi> as for the ſecurity of the Places in the <hi>Low Countreys.</hi> And to give them a larger Teſtimony thereof, his Majeſty hath charged the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> General of his Forces, to attend their anſwer, during the month of <hi>June,</hi> in the neighbourhood of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> with orders not to attack any place during that time.</p>
            <p>That conſequently, the States General, to give pregnant proof of the deſire they have to conclude the War, and to teſtifie the Candour of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, would not wait till the expiration of the month of <hi>June,</hi> much leſs make uſe of the ſaid Ceſſation of Arms, which was to begin on the firſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96323:30"/> of <hi>July,</hi> as it was at their liberty to do: but from the <hi>22th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> have aſſured his Majeſty by their Letter, that though they had laboured very ſtrenuouſly with their Allies, to diſpoſe them to the ſaid Peace, and that they could not be ſatisfied that all would concur therein; yet they had ordered their Ambaſſadors at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> to Conclude and Sign the Troaty, with his Majeſties Ambaſſadors, together with thoſe of their Allies, who were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to condeſcend thereunto; and that they were very certain, his Majeſty the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would alſo accept of the Peace, upon the Conditions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on his account, And his Moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty has been ſo gracious as to give them an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, by Letter dated the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> that he underſtood, with ſatisfaction, by their ſaid Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that without expecting the time which he had granted them for a Ceſſation of Arms, they had ſent the ſaid Orders to their Ambaſſadors, to Sign the Treaty of Peace, before the end of <hi>June,</hi> and that the aſſurance they gave his Majeſty, that thoſe of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King would accept of them at the ſame time, did give him to underſtand, that there were very favourable inclinations for the quiet of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and that likewiſe his Majeſty did perſwade himſelf, that he could not be long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded by their Allies; who till this very hour, what inſtances ſoever they had made, had refuſed to give their Concurrence to ſo great a Benefit, and ſo Univerſally deſired.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty Declaring farther, that though the uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual Cuſtom in ſuch Caſes requires, that things ſhould continue in the ſame condition they are in, till the Peace be abſolutely Conſummated by an exchange of Ratifications, and a publication of the Treaties;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96323:30"/> that yet upon their account, he had ſent his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Orders to the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> to withdraw his Army from the adjacent parts of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and March them into his own Countreys; and that he Charged the ſaid Duke, for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to agree with the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> as alſo their Envoys with him, about the Conduct that ſhould be among the Officers that were to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Troops, which his Majeſty was obliged to leave in the places about the Town of <hi>Mons;</hi> as alſo how they ſhould live of one ſide as well as the other, without Hoſtility in a good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with Liberty in the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> till the Exchange of the Ratiſications with <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all this, it evidently follows, that the Intentions, as well of his Majeſty as the Lords the States General, have been from the beginning, to make a General Peace, upon ſuch Conditions as all the Allies might have agreed unto; and being very uncertain, whether the ſaid Allies would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate themſelves by the Conditions his Majeſty had propoſed, and having Explained himſelf, that he would admit of no Alteration, their Lordſhips have deſired an Explanation of his Majeſties Intentions toward them, and of the Conditions that concerned them, and have had the good fortune to receive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, not only from the mouth of his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, but alſo by two Letters from his Majeſty himſelf; that in reſpect to them, they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſaid Conditions, and particularly thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> though his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty, or any other of his Allies ſhould obſtruct the Peace, upon condition, that when they Conclude the Treaty, they ſhould not directly. not indirectly Aſſiſt their Allies, againſt his Majeſty or
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96323:31"/> his Allies whilſt the War ſhould continue; by which it is manifeſtly apparent, that it has been no ways his Majeſties intention to retard, or protract the Peace or the effects thereof by any means whatſoever: as to thoſe that ſhould, who would be ready, and in a condition to make a Concluſion, though ſome other perſons ſhould not as yet prove ſo; and to contract only, that thoſe who ſhould ſubſcribe the Peace, ſhould not aſſiſt directly nor indirectly thoſe that would continue the War againſt his Majeſty or his Allies. And thus it is altogether incredible that ſo Generous a ſoul as his Majeſties, after ſuch clear and Indiſputable Declarations, as are contained in his Letters could entertain ſuch a Sentiment; and certainly their Lordſhips the States General would be extremely ſurpriſed, if his Majeſties Intentions ſhould be found Conformable to the Expreſſions of the ſaid <hi>Memorial</hi> it being a very Erroneous Poſition, that their Lordſhips the States General did ever De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that they found all the Conditions equitable which his Majeſty had propoſed, having never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained themſelves, but in thoſe things which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to their own particular intereſts, and having alſo demanded time to Diſpoſe their Allies to what may farther be required.</p>
            <p>Beſides that, it is moſt certain, a Declaration of that Nature was never required of them; that even his Majeſty himſelf having weighed the Scruple, which they were to be ſatisfied in, that all their Allies could not poſſibly be Inclined to accept of the Conditions propoſed, did anticipate them, by his Declaration, that not withſtanding all this, upon their own, as well as the King of <hi>Spains</hi> account, he would ever condeſcend to them, provided they would put a period to their Treaty upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96323:31"/> that were offered, and hath given ſufficient Teſtimony, that it was neither his own, nor the Intentions of the States General, that they ſhould be obliged to the Loan or Payment of any other thing, but what concerned them particularly, or related to ſuch of their Allies, as were ready to Concur with them in making a Peace; and that his Majeſty as to thoſe that ſhould continue the War, would require only a Neutrality of them, having in no reſpect propoſed or agreed to Second his Allies, and to afford them that Satisfaction they pretend to; which nevertheleſs, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors do now lay claim to in the forementioned Memorial, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to his Majeſties Declarations, if the ſaid Ambaſſadors would pleaſe to call to mind the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer they gave at the Conference on the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> paſſed, when they openly clear'd themſelves upon the point of the Concluſion and Signing of the Treaties, they muſt neceſſarily agree in this, that he hath been, and that they were ready to Sign with all thoſe Allies, who would declare themſelves to Condeſcend thereunto without any ſtipulation for the <hi>Swede,</hi> or any Delay on that account, having only recommended to them the Continuance of their endeavours with the Allies, with a promiſe that they would effect as much with their own Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates: being farther moſt certain, that during the whole Courſe; of the Negotiation they never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended any thing as to the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Intereſt; nay not when the Matter of the Reſtitution of the places, which ſhould ſerve as a Bar, was Debated.</p>
            <p>And it is ſomewhat ſurprizing, that the foreſaid Ambaſſadors ſhould poſitively affirm in the ſaid Memorial, that his Majeſty did never Condeſcend to the Reſtitution of Places to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96323:32"/> draw a Conſequence from ſo General and Ambiguous a propoſition to all particular Conditions, which in purſuance of that propoſition are expreſſed by very different ways and Stipulations; no otherwiſe than if they would deduce the ſame Conſequence from that which is after mentioned concerning the Princes of <hi>Strasburg</hi> and <hi>Fuſtemberg: viz,</hi> That their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts ought to make up one of the firſt points of that Peace, it being however an Affair that concerns none of the <hi>Confederates,</hi> the Emperor excepted, and that particularly too. Nor beſides have the Ambaſſadors conſidered, that his Majeſty by his Letters of the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> and <hi>1ſt</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> did explain himſelf ſo clearly and ſo poſitively, that he was Content, provided the States General did on their part, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and Sign the Peace, and that he would always agree to the Conditions profered to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> they only promiſing not to Aſſiſt their Allies that are willing to continue the War againſt his Majeſty, or his Confederates: ſo that the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions offered, as well to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as their Lordſhips ought to be performed, though the other Allies will not Concur in the making of a Peace; not only when the King of <hi>Swedes</hi> ſhould be re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; and receive Satisfaction, but when they had promiſed the ſaid Neutrality.</p>
            <p>The Lords the States General deſire ſervently and Cordially, that the War in the Northern parts ſhould be ended by convenient means: but his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty and the King of <hi>Swedes,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to Agree upon Conditions with the Allies of their Lordſhips they will look upon the Continuation of the War with great Diſſatisſaction; but yet in the interim they are apt to believe, that the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors are miſtaken, when they would Infer from
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96323:33"/> thence, That his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty might lawfully make uſe of the Territories and Places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and their State, to make a more advantageous War.</p>
            <p>They call his Countreys and Territories their own, becauſe that according to the Treaty of Peace, they ought to belong to them, by the ſame right as the other Lands and Provinces, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all controverſie, appertain to them.</p>
            <p>It is very certain, that the Countrey of his Electoral Highneſs of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, and alſo thoſe belonging to the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> more commodiouſly by thoſe Countreys which the States General at preſent poſſeſs; but as his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty did never pretend, and his Ambaſſadors would do ill to pretend, that his Majeſty might lawfully make uſe of their Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and Places to that purpoſe; nor can they pretend any more, that his Majeſty can make uſe of thoſe Places, which he hath engaged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore, having reſerv'd no ſuch kind of Right to himſelf, nor any thing whatſoever in order to ſuch a deſign; but onely the ſaid Neutrality of the Parties contracting with him; it being obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that nothing in the world can be more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the Neutrality, than to grant one Party the power to employ thoſe Territories and Places to infeſt and indemniſie the other Parties, nor more prejudicial to the Intereſts of their Lordſhips, than thereby to bring upon themſelves the miſchiefs and inconveniences of a War in their Neighbourhood, and even to their very Frontiers; ſo that in lieu of enjoying the ſweetneſs and effects of a Peace, and being aſcertain'd of a Boundary for their ſecurity and repoſe, they ſhall find themſelves deſtitute
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96323:33"/> on one ſide, and infeſted by a thouſand inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies on the other.</p>
            <p>What the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors ſay farther in that Memorial, merits 2 very particular reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that their Sentiments in the preſent caſe are conformable to the practiſe in all other Treaties; it being very notorious, that when there is a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Treaty made, all the Contractors ought to have ſatisfaction, which cannot be applied to the caſe in hand. His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty having thought good to enter into a particular Negotiation with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the States General, without ſharing with the other Allies, which would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur therein. Tis true, that if the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or the States General, ſhould not perform the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſuch a General Treaty, but fail therein, his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty might juſtly demand the effect of the Conditions agreed unto: but theſe two Powers being altogether diſpoſed to ſatisfie in all, and by all, which they are engaged to, on their behalf, his Majeſty cannot have the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that they ſhould be fruſtrated of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of what ſhould be promiſed them by particular Treaties, and upon conſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they ſhould ſet their hands. Over and above, that his Majeſty, having put into the firſt Article of his Propoſitions, the entire ſatisfaction the <hi>Swede</hi> ſhould have, which is now made the ground of all the preſent difficulties, explains himſelf in the ſame Period by theſe words, [That without them, he could not conclude upon all the reſt.] Whence it ought to be inferred, without all manner of diſpute, that he would not deſiſt in caſe of a General Treaty; but that it was not intended to apply it to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96323:34"/> the caſe of particular Conventions, which is now in queſtion.</p>
            <p>The Allegations which are made to this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Treaty, and the example of <hi>Verceil,</hi> the reſtitution whereof the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath promiſed, are not at all applicable here; for that Places was in his own hands, and he might diſpoſe of it as he thought good: but in our caſe, they have not onely not demanded any reſtitution, either from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or the States General, as indeed it could not juſtly be required of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not all poſſeſſed of any thing that appertained to the <hi>Swede;</hi> his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty propoſing no other matter to them, but the Neutrality onely: and there might, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, be drawn a ſolid Argument from the ſame Treaty of the <hi>Pyrenaeans,</hi> to juſtifie what is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pretended to, concerning the Evacuation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the reſtitution of the Places to <hi>Spain,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the continuation of the War between that Crown and <hi>Portugal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis true, that in the project of Treaties, there is no mention at all made of the Time when the Places ſhould be reſtored; but it is certain and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that the Conſequence of a Treaty is the immediate Exchange of Ratifications, after which, full ſatisfaction ought to be given to all that is promiſed and agreed unto, without any limitation of time; and to that end there can be nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied more Authentick, than what his Majeſty. was pleaſed to alledge in his laſt Letter of the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> paſs'd, where he ſays, That it is the uſual cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in all Treaties, for all things to continue in the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96323:34"/> ſtate they are in, till the Peace be abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated by Exchange of Ratifications, and the Publication of them; and that conſequently it were directly contrary to that uſage, for his Majeſty to pretend to detain the places, after the Ratifications duly Exchanged, and the Publication made. Their Lordſhips may diſpenſe with the Diſcourſe of the Conduct of his Majeſties Army in the <hi>Spaniſh Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> after the return of Monſieur <hi>de Lanoy,</hi> who brought back his Majeſty's Anſwer of the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> made to theirs of the <hi>22d.</hi> of the ſame month; but in the mean time they afflict themſelves, not without reaſon, becauſe that by all theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, ſo ill grounded, the Concluſion and Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Treaties hath been retarded, and even refuſed; when as their Ambaſſadors did duly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves to thoſe of his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, according to their promiſe, becauſe that their Lordſhips could by no means endure, that the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> no more than they themſelves to their extreme prejudice, ſhould be diſappointed in the principal effect of Peace; namely, of the Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of the ſaid Places, and conſequently of the Boundary, which his Majeſty had ſo frequently and ſolemnly aſſured them.</p>
            <p>Their High and Mighty Lordſhips ſincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that they deſire nothing more cordially, than to ſee the Peace eſtabliſhed between his Majeſty, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and their own State joyntly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with all the Confederates that will ſubſcribe it; and that they are willing, and ready alſo to cauſe the Treaties to be Concluded and Signed: But we cannot juſtly deſire of them, that the ſaid Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould depend upon the ſucceſs of Affairs, and a Reſtitution and Satisfaction, which according to all
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96323:35"/> humane apprehenſion, will not be regulated, but by the ſucceſs of the War, the Accidents and Chances whereof are always expoſed to incertainty.</p>
            <p>Tis further to be taken into conſideration, that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> has not to this hour given any order for the ſatisfaction of their High and Mighty Lordſhips, in regard of the juſt complaints, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive damages of their Subjects; nay, not ſo much as to renew and re-eſtabliſh their ancient Amity with them; but contrarily, daily add new prejudices to their Negotiation, by Acts of Hoſtility, directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Treaties proviſionally eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>And as his Majeſty ought rationally to expect, from the Lords the States General, that they ſhould ever look upon his Royal Word as firm and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, they cannot be perſuaded, that he would by any means whatſoever alter the Conditions which he hath propoſed by ſo remarkable a Change; and are ſo much the more aſſured thereof, in that their Ambaſſadors at <hi>London,</hi> having repreſented to his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> the ſcruple of this new upſtart Difficulty, his Majeſty did anſwer them with aſſurance, that there ſhould be no ſtop upon it; and thereby they have been ſtrongly perſuaded, that this delay was to be imputed, not to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Sentiments, but to the perſuaſion of thoſe who deſire not a Peace: but that however they hope his Majeſty, according to the greatneſs of his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, will take off that Delay.</p>
            <p>As to the Propoſition the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors made in their Memorial, the Lords the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral do conſider it two very different ways; either as an Expedient to accommodate the Affairs of the Northern Powers, by amicable means; or elſe to employ their Forces to oblige their Allies to return
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96323:35"/> the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> their Conqueſts, obtain'd du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this War. As to the firſt, they doubt not that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors are ſufficiently perſuaded, with what ſervor they deſired to ſee the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of a General Peace; and they ſhall never be better ſatisfied in any thing, than in ſeeing it concluded, and that they will always continue to interpoſe, and uſe their utmoſt endeavours to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Benefit ſo much deſired; intreating his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that he will pleaſe to furniſh them with means in order thereunto, their Ambaſſadors being fully informed of their good intentions, without being obliged to the Evacuation of Places: But if it be his Majeſties inclination to engage them, in purſuance of that propoſition to violence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, they find themſelves obliged to ſay, That they underſtand no manner of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ity therein, and that it is diametrically oppoſite to, what his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty did himſelf judge reaſonable, and that they can by no means ſubſcribe it, not being able at all to prevail with themſelves but by force; they muſt engage their Allies, with whom they have been concern'd in the ſame Obligations, to reſtore what they have taken from the <hi>Swediſh</hi> King, and ſo conſequently muſt be neceſſitated to take up Arms againſt their Friends and Confederates; a thing altogether unheard of, and which cannot juſtly be required of them; his Majeſty having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times declar'd, that as for himſelf and his Allies, and in confideration of their Mighty Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and theirs, he onely demanded the Neutrality before-mention'd.</p>
            <p>And thus the Lords the States General do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelves, that the French Ambaſſadors, as well as all thoſe that are not prepoſſeſs'd, will be

               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:96323:37"/> convinced, that their Lordſhips are no way in fault, if the Peace be not immediatly Concluded, and that the obligation to the Retention of the Towns cannot be imputed to them, it being ſo prejudicial to the Intereſt of their Affairs, that they can never be able to conſent to it.</p>
            <p>They farther declare, that they will joyntly uſe their utmoſt endeavours, for the accomodation of the Northern Powers, who are now at War, and who in effect, Conform themſelves to the Expedient, which the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors have propoſed: but if their Reflection be applied by way of Force and Conſtraint, it cannot be in their opinion and expedient, but a thing never heard of, that by the Treaty of Peace, inſtead of diſengaging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the War, they ſhould be conſtrained to turn it againſt their Allies. They do not at all doubt, that his Majeſty has a Deſign to procure the Quiet of <hi>Europe,</hi> and they will voluntarily Contribute on their part, all they can poſſibly, but they cannot by any means expect from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Juſtice, that he would oblige them to it, after ſo prejudicial a manner as the Retention of the Places will prove, and upon ſo vexatious a Condition, as that of waging War againſt their Allies, their Mighty Lordſhips, as they are wholly bent upon the Contribution of all friendly Offices, for the accommodation of the ſaid Affairs in the North. So alſo, they promiſe themſelves farther, that his Majeſty will be willing to iſſue out neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Orders for the Concluſion and Signing of the Peace upon the Conditions profer'd, and that he will furniſh them with Expedients, to Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute alſo on their part, to the Repoſe of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:96323:37"/>
            <p>This is that which the Lords the States General of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> have thought good to give in anſwer to the Memorial of the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, at the ſame time Ordering their own Ambaſſadors, to appear forward in the Conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Signing the Peace, and moſt carneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the ſaid <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors to Concur with them in that Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>But if the Completing of ſo beneficial a Work, and ſo univerſally deſired, be delayed upon the account of retaining the Places, the ſaid Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the Lords the States General, are obliged to proteſt in the name and behalf of the Lords their Maſters, that their High and Mighty Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips do no ways obſtruct the Peace from being brought to a happy Iſſue.</p>

            <p>THe Declaration of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, that the Places ſhould not be Surrendered to <hi>Spain</hi> and the States General, before the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſhould receive ſatisfaction, is ſo Juſt and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty cannot but thereby come off with Honour, and the King our Maſter with great Satisfaction. We could wiſh that that Declaration might have reduced our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemies to Reaſon; but ſince it hath met with great oppoſition, as appears by the Memorial of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96323:38"/> the <hi>Holland</hi> Ambaſſadors, his Moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty will without doubt Examine, if to arrive at the end propoſed thereby; in conſideration of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of <hi>Sweden,</hi> it will be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to defer the Reſtitution of the Places with the proſpect of making a general Peace, of elſe agree to it as the States General deſire, to the end there may be procur'd a Compleat particular Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> and States General, as well for <hi>France</hi> as <hi>Sweden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On our part, we are not ſufficiently informed what thoughts the King our Maſter may have upon this Affair; but as our Orders in general are, that we ought to Conform our ſelves to the pleaſure of <hi>France</hi> in the like Caſe, that we have good proof of the Intentions and Care of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and that we have not the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to Correſpond with the King our Maſter, to underſtand his Orders, We can aſſure you, that the King our Maſter will remain ſatisfied with what his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ſhall judge ſit to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, upon the account of the ſaid Reſtitution of Places, as we do alſo put our whole confidence in his Majeſties Royal prudence, who one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will furniſh him with ſuch means as may tend to his own Glory; together with the abſolute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of his Ally.</p>
            <p>This is all we have Order to ſay; but if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, we muſt explain our mind more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, we are apt to believe, that in this preſent juncture of Affairs, the Compleating a particular Peace, by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Swede,</hi> with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Hollander,</hi> would prove advantageous to the common Intereſt, and withall Glorious to his

            <p n="6">6. To be able to act Victoriouſly by force of Arms, againſt the ſaid Confederates, in caſe that they refuſe an Accommodation; the War being to be carried on againſt them with greater eaſe, when they are ſeparated from thoſe that have aſſorded them the greateſt Supplies.</p>
            <p>Beſides it will be very Honorable for his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To be able once more to reſtore Peace to Chriſtendom.</p>

               <hi>A Memorial given in by the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of the States General, to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of</hi> France, <hi>the</hi> 4th. <hi>of</hi> Auguſt, 1678.</head>
            <p>THe Ambaſſador and Envoy Extraordinary of their Lordſhips the States General of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> having ſent to their Hi. and Mi. the Memorial of the Lords Ambaſſadors of <hi>France,</hi> of the <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> have received expreſs order from their Maſters to anſwer their Excellencies, that they were tranſported to underſtand thereby the continuance of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's real intentions for Peace; and that themſelves will not be wanting on their part to do whatever may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the concluding it, and that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſorry to ſee it ſtick ſolely upon giving the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſatisfaction, and that that ſhould be of ſuch conſideration to his Majeſty, as to be capable of giving a ſtop to the finiſhing a work that is ſo much deſired.</p>
            <p>The States General think, that they have done all that could poſſibly be expected from a State, that is a Lover of Peace; having declared their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96323:41"/> of the Conditions which the King himſelf had propoſed, as far as they concern themſelves; and having laboured to the utmoſt of their power to bring their Allies to a compliance; in which endeavours they have been ſo ſucceſsful with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he likewiſe accepts the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that concern himſelf. And yet after all this, to their great ſorrow, they find themſelves deprived of the benefit of thoſe Conditions, not upon the account of any thing that might or ought to have been done by them, but becauſe the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> muſt firſt be ſatisfi'd, though neither his Catholick Majeſty nor themſelves poſſeſſed any thing that muſt make part of his ſatisfaction; and though the ſaid King continue daily to exerciſe all manner of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilities againſt their Inhabitants, directly contrary to Treaties ſolemnly ratifi'd.</p>
            <p>Yet their Hi. and Mi. notwithſtanding their Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants meet with ſuch bad uſage from the ſaid King, and though they have evidently had juſt cauſe to fall upon him, and make War upon him, as he does upon them, have choſen rather to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a Peace in the North, and have offered to do all good offices in order to it; if his moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty will be pleaſed to furniſh them with ſome Expedients; and they do yet perſiſt in the ſame mind, and ſhould be ready to propoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients themſelves, if they knew of any: But they cannot in any wiſe expect from his Majeſties generous diſpoſition, that after having teſtifi'd ſo much good will to them, he ſhould oblige them to act forcibly againſt their Allies; and that, not to procure his Majeſty better ſatisfaction, but meerly for the benefit of his Ally.</p>
            <p>Their Hi. and Mi. will ever profeſs a great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96323:41"/> for his Majeſty, and will bear him as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as he can poſſibly deſire; but they do not ſee of what uſe it will be to put his Majeſty to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by ſending their Deputies to St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> not having any themſelves to propoſe to him; for the Places muſt be Evacuated when the Treaty is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, in diſcharge of that ſolemn promiſe which his Majeſty made to them; and as to that, there remains no difficulty. And concerning the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> as his Majeſties Ally, they offer to do all friendly offices for his Accommodation; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuch endeavours cannot be made with greater likelihood of ſucceſs any where elſe, than at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen,</hi> where all the Miniſters of the Confederates are: There we may labour to diſpoſe them, with hopes of ſucceſs; there we may be informed of what-ever may be neceſſary to promote the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, and may uſe all manner of endeavours, which cannot be ſo ſucceſsful, either at St. <hi>Quintin</hi> or at <hi>Ghent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The States General conceive the leſs hopes from ſuch a Deputation, becauſe the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> did not inſtance, as to what Expedients in particular their Deputies ſhould come inſtructed: and they think his Majeſty may propoſe what he would have, and do what-ever is to be done ſooner, and more readily at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> than either at St: <hi>Quintin</hi> or any other Place. They deſire with all their hearts, that his Majeſty would propoſe ſome Expedients to further the Peace; and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will at the ſame time make appear, how af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately they deſire to help forward, as much as in them lies, the perfecting this great work: and they earneſtly deſire, that the time may be well husbanded, for that as yet they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96323:42"/> in a condition able to conclude a Peace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the terms that have been propoſed, though they have been involv'd in a great deal of trouble, and been put upon a neceſſity of entring into new Engagements, by their manner of acting, whoſe expectations are not anſwered by the Peace, and who repreſented the Evacuation of the Places to their Hi. and Mi. as a thing to be deſpaired of; though they made thoſe Engagements with ſuch caution and regard to his Majeſty, that they can be of no effect, unleſs the matter ſhould fall out ſo unfortunately, as that his Moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhould ſet ſuch a value upon the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s Satisfaction, and not to reſolve to Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate the Places but upon thoſe terms, though the Exchange of the Ratifications enſued upon it.</p>
            <p>The States General do inſtantly deſire his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to conclude the Treaties, and not to ſuffer the finiſhing them to ſtick at the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s Satisfaction; and to make them ſo happy, as to give them ſome aſſurance, as ſoon as may be, by taking up a favourable reſolution, which is the thing they ſo greatly deſire.</p>

               <hi>It is evident, that his Majeſty doth not incline to any Party, but out of his deſire to finiſh the affair of the Peace as ſoon as may be; and out of the confidence that he repoſeth in the word of the States General, he hath always deſired, that they would ſend their Deputies, either to himſelf, or to</hi> Ghent, <hi>both to concert what will be neceſſary for the warranting to his Majeſty the Engagement that</hi> Spain <hi>is to enter into, of not aſſiſting his Enemies, nor thoſe of his Allies, and to agree upon ſuch means as his Majeſty ſhould propoſe to them, for the more eaſie reſtoring of</hi> Sweden, <hi>without obliging them to enter into a War in order to it:</hi>

               <hi>The ſaid Ambaſſadors cannot doubt, but that ſuch an overture will remove thoſe difficulties that have hindred the States General, and that as the ſigning their Treaty, and that of</hi> Spain, <hi>was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, onely by his Majeſties pretending to retain all the Places; ſo his deſiſting from that, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to ſign the Peace.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96323:43"/> Ambaſſadors and Plenipotentiaries of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, how they have acted through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this affair, by which it will appear not to be long of them, that the Treaty is not at preſent ready to be perfected and Signed.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, as the regulation of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce makes the principal point of the Treaty on the part of the States General, the ſaid Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of <hi>Sweden</hi> have offered all the facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that could be deſired of them in order to it. It was upon the <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> that the Count of <hi>Oxenſtierne</hi> preſented an Article for referring this affair to Commiſſioners, which not being agreed to, and the Ambaſſadors of the States General, declaring that their Principals and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters deſired to ſee the regulation finiſhed before the Peace were concluded, the ſaid Count of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſtierne</hi> conſented to enter into the particulars of the States Project of Commerce, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, on the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> acquainted Monſieur <hi>de Beverning,</hi> Ambaſſador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the States General, that he had drawn a Counter-Project upon ſome Articles not yet agreed; which Counter-Project having been read to the Sieur <hi>de Beverning,</hi> was immediately by his advice delivered to Sieur <hi>Silvercroon,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary of <hi>Sweden,</hi> with orders to go quickly to the <hi>Hague,</hi> and help to inform the States General more fully by Word of mouth, of the reaſons upon which the Counter-Project was grounded, the ſaid Sieur <hi>de Beverning</hi> affirming likewiſe that he had writ to his Principals and Maſters, to appoint Commiſſioners to confer all matters with him as ſoon as might be. Which though the ſaid Sieur <hi>Silvercroon</hi> immediately did, and the States
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96323:44"/> General received the Counter-Project, yet now in ſeven weeks time they have not return'd their anſwer to it, and remitted the affair hither to be adjuſted and finiſhed, by the Ambaſſadors and Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries of both parties: in order whereunto the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Sweden</hi> have not failed all this time to make frequent inſtances, both here at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> where they have been aſſiſted by the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France,</hi> and at the <hi>Hague</hi> by the Sieur <hi>Silvercroon.</hi> Beſides this point of Commerce, as there have been ſome complaints made that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Veſſels laden with Corn, and belonging to the Subjects of this State, have been taken and carried to <hi>Straelſond,</hi> and that Count <hi>Conningſmark</hi> had taken out their lading to ſerve for food for his Army, the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Sweden</hi> having been informed of the ſaid complaints by the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the States General, gave in a Declaration the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> that the ſaid action of the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of <hi>Connigſmark</hi> could not be reputed any other than a meer act of neceſſity, which he then was reduced to, through want of Victuals and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence; that the parties concern'd ſhould be ſatisfied to the full, and that he would paſs any ſuch Act to that end as ſhould be thought fit, knowing that ſuch was the King his Maſters inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſame has likewiſe bin aſſured by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary <hi>Silvercroon</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and an extract has ſince been delivered of a Letter from the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>de Coningſmark,</hi> containing the like aſſurances, together with a relation how he had acted, and that he had paid the Maſters of the Ships their Freight. Which things being ſo, the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>Sweden</hi> believed that the States General would have received all the ſatisfaction they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:96323:44"/> could poſſibly deſire, and that nothing was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conclude a Peace betwixt the King their Maſter, and them, but to prepare ſuch Articles as are uſual almoſt in all Treaties of Peace, which would be no hard work for the Ambaſſadors of both parties to do. But in ſtead of that, they are ſurpriſed to underſtand, that there have been very bitter complaints againſt <hi>Sweden,</hi> in the anſwers that the Ambaſſadors of the States General gave on the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> and the <hi>7th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to the Memorials of the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France,</hi> and though the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Sweden</hi> have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore explained and declared themſelves, as is before mentioned, yet they would not omit giving ſome proper anſwer to them, but that having agreed with the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France,</hi> that for the avoiding all ſharpneſs, neither of them will meddle in things of that nature, they are willing to paſs them all over with ſilence, and to endeavour ſomething of reality; to which end they repeat their inſtances here at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> as Monſieur <hi>Boreel</hi> cannot but know, as well as at the <hi>Hague</hi> by the Sieur <hi>Silvercroon,</hi> that the States General would advance the Negotiation with <hi>Sweden,</hi> that the Peace may be concluded at the ſame time that it ſhall be with <hi>France,</hi> ſince one cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other.</p>
            <p>And the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Sweden</hi> apprehended, that the reiterating their inſtances had produced a good effect, ſince the Sieur <hi>Silvercroon</hi> ſent word from the <hi>Hague,</hi> by the laſt Courrier, That he had been conferr'd with, and that the Anſwer to the Counter-project was ready to be ſent to <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whilſt they were in this expectation, the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96323:45"/> Ambaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> inform them, That but yeſterday the Ambaſſadors of the States General renew'd their complaints againſt <hi>Sweden,</hi> for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing difficulties, and that Count <hi>Coningſmark</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed acts of Hoſtility, Confiſcating Ships and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go's belonging to the Subjects of this State; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the States had more reaſon to continue the War, than to think of a Peace with <hi>Sweden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which the ſaid Ambaſſadors perceiving with ſorrow, that but little reflection is made upon what they have heretofore advanced, and being alſo very certain, that Monſieur <hi>Coningſmark</hi> hath not confiſcated any thing belonging to the Subjects of this State, nor done any acts of Hoſtility againſt them, ſince they agree to make amends for all; and ſeeing how lightly the good Offices are thought on, which the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Sweden</hi> have done ſince they came to <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> to further a Peace for the benefit of this State; and even the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which they have but lately uſed with his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, to facilitate the Evacuation of the Places; do entreat the Ambaſſadors of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, to anſwer and repreſent to the Ambaſſadors of the States General, that they do ill to complain of <hi>Sweden,</hi> after it has offered ſo many facilities, and made ſo many advances; and conſequently to induce them, inſtead of exaſperating matters, rather to expreſs ſuch readineſs and faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity on behalf of the States General, as may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be expected from them, that ſo both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may receive that ſatisfaction which they wiſh for, in the concluſion of a good Peace. The ſaid Ambaſſadors of <hi>Sweden</hi> hope, that the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral have no intentions of protracting the Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Peace with <hi>Sweden,</hi> to the end that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96323:45"/> may be able to make a Separate Peace with his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, excluding <hi>Sweden;</hi> but they think notwithſtanding, that to prevent all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, it were well, if all hopes of ſuch a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were taken away.

               <hi>A Memorial of the</hi> Deputies Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, <hi>of the States General of the</hi> United Provinces, <hi>to the Duke</hi> de Villa Hermoſa, <hi>of the</hi> 8th <hi>of</hi> May.</head>
            <p>THE Lords, the States General of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> having Affairs of great importance to impart to your Excellence, have Commiſſionated us under-written their Deputies Extraordinary, and to this end their Hi. and Mi. have provided us of this Letter of Credit, to preſent to your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>The Aſſiſtances which his Catholique Majeſty gave to the State of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> in the beginning of this War, were ſo uſeful and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to this Commonwealth, that their Hi. and Mi. ſhall ever be mindful of it: And to teſtifie, as ſoon as was poſſible, their reſentment thereof to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty, they failed not to come with all their Forces to his Majeſtie's ſuccour, when his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces were attack'd by the Arms of the King of <hi>France;</hi> and they aſſure themſelves that your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence is perſwaded of it, ſince your Excellence ſees how much their Hi. and Mi. do to this day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the preſervation of his Majeſtie's Country. And notwithſtanding this War has been continued many years, and at an infinite expence, yet the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects have been ſo unfortunate, that the King of <hi>France,</hi> being puff'd up with his Victories and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, will not come out of it, but upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that have been delivered at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> to the Mediators, which your Excellence knows what they are.</p>
            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:96323:77"/>
            <p>Which Conditions, conſidered in themſelves, are indeed too hard, and of ſuch a nature as they ought to be rejected, which alſo their Hi. and Mi. would do in regard of their Allies, and chiefly in regard of his Catholick Majeſty, as concerning the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> in the preſervation whereof they find themſelves ſo deeply intereſſed.</p>
            <p>But when their Hi. and Mi. reflect upon the Power of the King of <hi>France,</hi> which hitherto and during this War has been ſuch, that he has not only made Head againſt the Armies of his Catholick Majeſty, and thoſe of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and their Allies, but has made great Conqueſts in divers Parts, they conceive a juſt apprehenſion, that theſe Conditions, how hard ſoever, ought yet to be prefer'd, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the preſent ſtate of Affairs, to a continuance of the War, which in all probability would prove very fatal.</p>
            <p>Which makes our Maſters the States General of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> incline to look upon theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as receivable, if they ſhould have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to find their Allies, and eſpecially his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſty in the ſame Sentiments.</p>
            <p>And ſhould very much wiſh, That your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, on the behalf of his Catholick Majeſty, would concur with them, to make them as agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as may be, to the other Allies.</p>
            <p>And in the mean time give Order to labour for a prolongation of the Term, which the King of <hi>France</hi> has given by his Propoſition at <hi>Nimeguen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We expect your Excellencie's Anſwer as ſoon as may be, upon the premiſſes, as being the only Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Commiſſion.</p>

            <p>HIS Excellence having conſidered this Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and that the loſs of <hi>Flanders,</hi> by the hardneſs of the Conditions of <hi>France,</hi> will be greater and more diſhonourable, than by the ill ſucceſs of Arms, muſt hope that the States General will not further it, ſince his Majeſty, wholly for its preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, has expoſed himſelf to the manifeſt hazards of War, which he has ſuffered ſo much by. Alſo the punctual and religious obſervance of ſuch ſtrict Treaties, with his ſaid Majeſty, to which the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith obligeth them, will not permit him to make a doubt of it, eſpecially ſince his Majeſty hath and always will havè a firm deſire and intention, to contribute as much as poſſibly he can to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and that in regard of the Expedient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, of making new Alliances, for the making ſure the ſaid impracticable Conditions of <hi>France,</hi> it is to be conſidered, that the time in which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely they muſt be concluded, can be no other than that of the Campagne, from which, by means of our ſo late Alliance with his Majeſty of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> we ought to expect, by a more proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, ſome redreſs of Affairs; and it would be a breach of Faith, to abandon his Forces in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, by admitting Conditions ſo forlorn, and at the ſame time failing in our Fidelity to his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial

            <p>THE Lords, the States General of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> having ſeen and peruſed your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie's Anſwer to the Memorial, that we, their under-written Deputies Extraordinary, preſented the 8th of this Moneth, could have wiſhed, That your Excellence had not only conſidered the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions offered by the King of <hi>France,</hi> as they are in themſelves, but had alſo made reflexion upon the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96323:79"/> preſent ſtate of Affairs, and conſidered, that the King of <hi>France,</hi> being become Maſter of all the Frontier Towns of his Catholick Majeſtie's <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> was entred into the heart of them, and had made himſelf Maſter even of the Town of <hi>Gand,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſtrong in the Field, and at the Head of a very formidable Army, ready for any enterprize, and in the greateſt appearance in the world of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and conquering where he will: Whereas the Troops of the Allies, not being yet come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, much leſs in a condition to make Head againſt him, and oppoſe his deſigns. Hence it is, that their Hi. and Mi. apprehend with great reaſon, that what remains to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> will infallibly be loſt, if it be not ſaved, by accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conditions of Peace that are offered; and it would be a thing very ſenſible to their Hi. and Mi. if what his Catholick Majeſty has yet left in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> ſhould be ſo loſt, after ſuch infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite expences, and ſo much blood ſpilt, for their preſervation. Your Excellence knows but too well, by what has lately happened, what Account one has to make of the Troops of the Confederates, upon occaſion. The Aſſiſtance which is expected from his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> is very conſiderable, and will be of great ſupport to our Party; but it deſerves your Excellencie's conſideration, that thoſe Troops are but newly raiſed, and that it will require ſome time to enure them to the War, that as yet there are but few of them in theſe Parts, and we are uncertain when the reſt will come; whereas on the other ſide, every moment is precious, and great misfortunes may happen in a ſhort ſpace. And moreover, the States, as they have made it to be declared to your Excellence, are not in a condition
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96323:79"/> to carry on the War, in ſuch manner, and with ſo much vigor, as they have done hitherto, ſeeing their Treaſures are exhauſted, and their People not able to contribute ſo much any longer.</p>
            <p>As the Lords, the States General, will always acknowledge to have received, in the beginning of this War, very important and uſeful Succours from his Catholick Majeſty, ſo they hope, your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence will do them the juſtice to confeſs, that they have not been wanting in the ſequel of it, to teſtifie their acknowledgment, by uſing their endeavours, and being at extraordinary charges to aſſiſt this Country; and at leaſt that it is not to be imputed to them, that the King of <hi>France</hi> has made ſo great a progreſs, and that he will not make Peace, but upon ſuch diſadvantagious Conditions, as whereby the Country will indeed be much weakned, and hardly able to maintain neceſſary Troops for its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; but on the other hand, the Places will not be ſo diſ-joyn'd, nor the Country ſo divided, as it was before the War, which will make it eaſier to be kept and preſerved. Theſe Defects may likewiſe be ſupplyed by Alliances, and a little time may do much toward a redreſs of Affairs, and making the King's Subjects, and particularly thoſe of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces,</hi> capable of aſſiſting one another; who at preſent are in ſo lamentable a condition, and ſo utterly unable, that they cannot be obliged to a continuance of the extraordinary charges, without great hazard, and without expoſing them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extremity, and finding our ſelves reduced to a neceſſity, either of accommodating with the Enemy, whether we will or no, or of lying down under the burden. To which they do not think your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence will be of opinion, That they ſtand obliged by
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96323:80"/> thoſe Treaties, that had no other end, than the good of the Allies, and the ſafety of their People. The ſaid Lords, the States General, have alſo thought fit, to have it repreſented to your Excellence, That being informed, That the Ambaſſadors and Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries of the King of <hi>France,</hi> would be authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to conclude upon a Truce, to the very laſt Day of <hi>December</hi> next; they have Ordered their Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> to diſcourſe it with them, and ſee whether they would make one for ſix Weeks, or three Months at moſt: Hoping, that if it can be obtain'd, your Excellence will not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with it, but agree to it, for ſuch Reaſons as have been alledged to your Excellence, by word of mouth, and as your Excellence may conſider with your ſelf.</p>

            <p>WE have heard the Propoſition that your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies made to us two days ſince, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96323:81"/> in ſubſtance, That the Lords, the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, could not carry on the War any longer, and found themſelves obliged to make Peace, for ſuch Reaſons as were then more particularly deduced. Your Excellencies would then have known our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents thereupon, and you deſire the ſame thing again at this preſent. Not to fail therein, we hope above all things, that your Excellencies and all the World will do his Imperial Majeſty the juſtice to believe, that he has always behav'd himſelf like a good and faithful Ally towards all, both in Peace and War. We will not enlarge upon that. His Army has always been ſeen in the Field, in great numbers, in good order; it is evident, that he has imploy'd it for the good of the common Cauſe, and that he has made it act in ſuch places as were thought moſt ſurable; 'twere needleſs to particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the Campagnes, where all was acted for the publick good. Moreover, his Imperial Majeſty has aſſiſted his Allies with all the Forces he could, if not with all he would: The Rebellion that has been raiſed againſt him in <hi>Hungary,</hi> is alſo publickly known, and how both his own Subjects, and the <hi>Turk</hi> and the <hi>Tartar</hi> have been ſtirred up againſt him; and yet ſo evident and ſo near a danger, has not been able to divert or decreaſe his Forces for the common Intereſts. Beſides, that it is known, he hath ſent his Army into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> to ſupport the acting there, whereby the Enemy had an opportunity to take <hi>Friburg</hi> from him, which makes ſo much difficulty now. As his Majeſty has been intent upon the Affairs of the War, ſo he has been no leſs upon thoſe of Peace: And, as your Excellencies can bear us witneſs, we his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors have neglected nothing that might promote it;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96323:81"/> and becauſe we believed, that the moſt effectual mean to obtain a reaſonable Peace, was to act vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly, we have done all we could, as hath been already ſaid.</p>
            <p>For the preſent, it cannot be doubted, but the Emperour will underſtand with ſorrow, That your Excellencies think Affairs reduced to ſuch extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that there is a neceſſity of making a Peace, to prevent greater: Your Excellencies have told us your Sentiments thereupon, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> theirs. As for our own, we find, in the firſt place, That this manner of acting from <hi>France,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Conditions of Peace, and admit no Treaties upon them, is againſt the ſtyle and the cuſtom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways practis'd among Soveraign Powers; and we are far from being able to diſcover by that, any ſuch deſire of Peace, as the <hi>French</hi> make ſo great oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of. For the Peace it ſelf, his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty deſires it as much as any, and deſires it may be general, that the publick repoſe may be obtain'd, which is his only aim, and the common ſafety alſo, which is the chief thing that ought to be procur'd by the ſaid Peace. Your Excellencies confeſs your ſelves, that the Conditions contain'd in the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>France,</hi> are too hard and violent; you have told us likewiſe, that your meaning is not, that we ought to paſs all the Contents of them. You have deſired to know our Sentiments upon this Subject, tendring the Offices of the States General, for reducing them to terms of Equity; and we, for our parts, told you then the Reaſons, why we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not explain our ſelves fully thereupon.</p>
            <p>Howſoever, we declar'd our ſelves here in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, to the Heer Ambaſſador <hi>Haren,</hi> that we could not admit of the Alternative, that concerns
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:96323:82"/> the Emperour and the Empire, barely as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. We have often deduced the Reaſons, as well why we cannot reſtore <hi>Philipsburg,</hi> as why we cannot leave <hi>Friburg</hi> in the hands of the <hi>French.</hi> We hope all the World will think them well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with all this we have not fail'd to acquaint the Emperour by a Courier Expreſs, whoſe return we expect. In the mean time, being willing to leave nothing undone on our ſide, that may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Peace, we again pray your Excellencies, to interpoſe thoſe good Offices which you offered us, to diſpoſe the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To admit of more equitable Conditions of Peace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To treat with us upon them, ſince we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on our ſide, and deſirous to do it with all kind of moderation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To take the ſame care for the Intereſts of our Allies, as for our ſelves, particularly for his Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who has been uſed worſt of all, and that the Eſtates of the Empire may alſo have due ſatisfaction.</p>

            <p>WHoſoever ſhall compare the time that is elaps'd, ſince the return of his Excellence the Heer Ambaſſador <hi>van Beverningh,</hi> from the Journey which he took to his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and ſince he communicated his Report only to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the High Allies at the <hi>Hague,</hi> with that within which they require of us a final Declaration, on behalf of his Majeſty the King our Maſter, upon ſo nice a matter, as concerns no leſs than an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute deciſion betwixt accepting a Peace, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the War, may eaſily obſerve, that it has not been ſufficient for us to receive neceſſary Orders from our Maſter thereupon, and apprehend, that it is not in the power of Miniſters, to determine of their own heads ſo important a reſolution.</p>
            <p>Fearing leſt this might happen, we required a convenient delay, by a Memorial delivered above eight days ago, into the hands of their Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the Lords, Ambaſſadors Extraordinary of the Lords the States General; but to this preſent no Anſwer thereunto has enſued, and inſtead thereof,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96323:83"/> the neceſſity of Affairs, the lamentable condition of the <hi>Spaniſh Low-Countries,</hi> the <hi>United Provinces</hi> not being able to raiſe ſupplies, for defraying the exceſſive expences of the War, what-ever hope we might have form'd to our ſelves of aſſiſtance from <hi>England,</hi> being utterly vaniſh'd, and the formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Power of the Enemy, are now laid for a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the meaſures that are to be taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that by Peace, which 'tis believ'd cannot be hindred by continuing the War. The King our Maſter could not underſtand theſe extremities, but with the utmoſt compaſſion and perplexity of mind; and if he be thought capable of bringing any reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on his ſide, we can give aſſurance on his behalf, that he will apply himſelf to it with the ſame gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, care and concern, out of which he has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto made appear by the effects, that his only content and repoſe conſiſts in the welfare of his Allies.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, it is a very difficult thing to give any counſel and advice, in a matter that ſeems to be already determined, and which ſticks at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the formality of its execution.</p>
            <p>On Saturday laſt, their Excellencies, the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of the Lords the States General, declar'd to us, That their Maſters ſaw no other mean to ſave themſelves from the ruine, which was like to drag them, through that of the <hi>Spaniſh Low-Countries,</hi> into the utter ſubverſion of their Common-wealth, than that of a ſudden Peace. They told us, That the Lords Ambaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> expreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſpos'd, to conclude one ſeparately with them, and all thoſe that ſhould deſire to come into it, they invited us to joyn with them in it, and at the ſame time aſſur'd us, that ſince of neceſſity they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96323:83"/> muſt avoid the confuſion, that the Anſwer they ſhould have to make to the Moſt Chriſtian King, concerning the accepting a ceſſation of Arms, would bring them into, they found themſelves obliged to make a Peace alone, to their own beſt advantage, before the end of this preſent Month, though we ſhould not be able in that time to concur with them in it; this ceſſation of Arms not being neceſſary to them, for their own particular intereſts.</p>
            <p>What room is left then for any counſel or advice in the Caſe? We ſee no other meaſures to take, for what concerns the King our Maſter, than to put their Excellencies, the Ambaſſadors of the Lords the States General, in mind of their own Aſſertion, to wit, That this Peace, even though they ſhould ſee themſelves obliged to make it with <hi>France,</hi> ſhould keep the Lords, the States General, their Maſters, no leſs under the power of their engagements, at the bottom of the mutual Treaties betwixt them and their Allies, and to pray them, as we do moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, to proceed in it with ſuch caution and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as that it may not at the ſame time involve any prejudicial conſequence to that of the North.</p>
            <p>The 18th Article of the Treaty betwixt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and the Lords the States General, upon the occaſion of the preſent War, ſhews plainly, how far his Majeſty and they ſtand mutually engaged to one another. We are bound in duty to inſiſt upon it, till we have received Orders from our Maſter to diſpence with it, which of our own heads we cannot do; and we conjure the Lords the States General, by what-ever is moſt ſacred in the publick Faith, and in ſuch ſolemn ſtipulations, not to do or take in hand any thing that may derogate from its force.</p>
            <pb n="152" facs="tcp:96323:84"/>
            <p>We wiſh for the Peace, as much as it can be wiſh'd for, and envy it not our Allies; if they will ſhew us a way to obtain a ſure and honourable Peace, we embrace it from this day forward; and if <hi>France</hi> will make a Peace with his Majeſty, we believe he is altogether ready to accept it, ſo it be founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Reaſon, and the good union, which will always keep him inſeparable from the fortune of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
            <p>Finally, We pray God to inſpire always the Lords the States General with Counſels worthy their moderation, and the conſideration which they ought to have, for thoſe whom themſelves have drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the perils of the preſent War, and to bleſs their Deſigns and Advances, for the ſecurity of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Quiet of all Chriſtendom.</p>

               <hi>A Declaration of the Ambaſſador of the</hi> Elector <hi>of</hi> Brandenburg, <hi>on Munday the</hi> 20th <hi>of</hi> June, 1678.</head>
            <p>THE Ambaſſador of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> ſays, That it was evident, that his Electoral Serenity his Maſter, before the Moſt Chriſtian King took up Arms againſt their Hi. and Mi. the States General, failed not to do all he could to divert him, and that likewiſe ſince the fire of this War has been kindled, he has deſired nothing more earneſtly, than to ſee it quench'd as ſoon as might be, and the publick repoſe every where eſtabliſh'd; and that it was upon the ſole conſideration of promoting the Peace, that his Electoral Serenity entred into ſuch ſtrict Bonds with
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:96323:84"/> his Allies, and eſpecially with their Hi. and Mi. that he hath expos'd and ſacrific'd his Perſon and Eſtates for that, and hath enjoyn'd his Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries at this Congreſs, and renews his Orders time after time, to labour for a Peace with their utmoſt endeavours, according to the Alliances betwixt the Confederates, which preſcribe a method to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for obtaining a general Peace, that was agreed on joyntly by them all. That their Excellencies, the Ambaſſadors of their Hi. and Mi. alledged two days ſince, that their Lordſhips, the States, both in reſpect of the condition of their own Provinces, and that of others, find themſelves at preſent redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a neceſſity of making a Peace with <hi>France,</hi> whether they will or no. That at the ſame time, to obſerve their Alliances, they expreſs a deſire to have their Allies joyn with them in it; but that withal they think themſelves neceſſitated, for the ſaving their Common-wealth from the ſhipwrack that threatens it, to make a Peace alone, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Confederates, in caſe they cannot accept the Conditions that <hi>France</hi> hath preſcribed; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they required the reſolution of their Allies with all ſpeed, that they might take their Meaſures thereby, at the Conſultation that is to be held this Week at the <hi>Hague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Plenipotentiary Ambaſſador of his Electoral Serenity ſays to it, That he knows not what reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his Maſter will take, for that he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Inſtructions from him in ſo ſhort a time, upon the Declaration which the Moſt Chriſtian King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered on the firſt of this Month of <hi>June,</hi> to the Heer Ambaſſador <hi>Van Beverning.</hi> That in the mean time he partly explain'd himſelf, as to his own private Sentiment, in the Memorial of the 10th of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96323:85"/> 
               <hi>June,</hi> which he preſented to the Ambaſſadors of their Hi. and Mi. and that he doubted not, but they made all due and fitting Reflexions thereupon. That for the reſt, he was fully perſwaded, though ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable neceſſity might diſpence with the States General, or ſhould oblige them to depart from any point of their Alliance with his Electoral Serenity, that yet they will always proceed in it with ſuch caution and ſincerity, as the foundation may ſubſiſt notwithſtanding, and his Electoral Serenity be at no prejudice, nor the band of their friendſhip and good underſtanding to be weakned.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Ambaſſador added two Points, requiring the ſaid Lords the States to conſider them, when they ſhould take this matter into conſideration. The one, That <hi>France,</hi> in the Project of Peace, which its Ambaſſadors propoſed here, doth not mention any Conditions, upon which it is willing to make a Peace with his Electoral Serenity; whereas, on his behalf, there have been Propoſals made to that end, both with relation to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he knows not yet whether <hi>France</hi> will make any Peace with himſelf or no. The other, That the Conditions propos'd in that Project, with relation to <hi>Sweden,</hi> were ſo abject, and even ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what their Hi. and Mi. have engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to procure his Electoral Serenity, that it muſt be believed, that <hi>France</hi> is not willing that a Peace ſhould be made with <hi>Sweden,</hi> inaſmuch as their Hi. and Mi. that ſee there is no room left for his Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Serenity to enter into the Peace, in conjunction with themſelves.</p>
            <p>Finally, The ſaid Ambaſſador promiſeth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the reſolution of his Moſt Serene Maſter, upon the ſaid Declaration of <hi>France,</hi> as ſoon as he
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96323:85"/> ſhall receive it, referring himſelf for other matters to his ſaid Memorial.</p>

            <p>THis Declaration could not be opened at large, becauſe the Preſident Canon had only formed the <hi>Idea</hi> of it in his mind, and return'd but the night before from the <hi>Hague;</hi> he alledged that Journey, as an excuſe for his not having been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the laſt Conference, ſaying, that he went to deliver the Lords the States General a Letter from his Maſter. Then he enlarged upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of the Alternatives, that were propoſed by <hi>France,</hi> as Conditions of Peace: The firſt, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Country 35 miles in length, and 16 or 18 in breadth, with 26 Cities upon it, and 600 Burroughs and Villages: The other, depriving him of his Capital City, and the convenience of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with his own Country, by pretending to paſs through ſome of the beſt of his High-ways. That both theſe Conditions were equally hard, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated by the Election that was left his Maſter to chuſe either. For the avoiding ſuch Imperious Laws, he referr'd himſelf to the Alliances made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Imperial and Catholick Majeſties, their Lordſhips the States General, and his late Uncle, and renewed ſince with his own perſon with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible extenſion, and withal recommended himſelf to the friendſhip and protection of all his Allies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96323:86"/> with a formal proteſtation, that he would reſolve rather to live baniſh'd from his Country, and entirely to maintain the Juſtice of his Title, and have his Allies that had contracted with him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue under their abſolute Engagements, than ever to return upon ſuch hard Conditions, and ſo ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous to his Birth, and his undoubted Right of Succeſſion, never having deſerv'd ſo ill of <hi>France,</hi> as to be uſed ſo cruelly.</p>

            <p>THE Ambaſſador of his Electoral Serenity of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> for the Treaties of Peace at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen,</hi> having ſeen the Memorial of the Lords Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of <hi>France,</hi> of the 17th. of <hi>July,</hi> wherein they endeavour to take away the Jealouſies that might ariſe, of the ſincerity of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's Intentions, and of his faithfulneſs to his Word, concerning the evacuation of the Places, which he promiſed to reſtore to <hi>Spain,</hi> and to their Hi. and Mi. the Lords the States General of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> thinks it fit, and according to his duty, to repreſent to the Lords the Ambaſſadors of the States General, who communicated to him the ſaid Memorial: That as it is full of almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:96323:87"/> elſe, in every paſſage, but great Deſigns, of the Moſt Chriſtian King, againſt his Electoral Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, his Maſter, and other Princes, that have made ſome Conqueſts upon <hi>Sweden;</hi> ſo his Electoral Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity promiſeth himſelf, as well from the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Lords the States, and their fidelity of Word, as from their juſtice and exactneſs, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the terms of the Alliance, that they will not help forward ſuch perniclous Deſigns, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be put in execution, againſt one of their ancienteſt and moſt faithful Friend, Neighbour and Ally, and that has been no leſs concern'd, for the preſervation and re-eſtabliſhment of their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, than of his own Inheritances, and has not ſtuck at expoſing, what-ever is moſt dear and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to him in the whole World, for their ſakes.</p>
            <p>It is evident, with what care his Electoral Sereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath governed all his Actions, ſo as not to give the leaſt ground of diſcontent to <hi>Sweden;</hi> and the ſincerity, with which he has renew'd former Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with that Crown, is no leſs apparent, by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them even to the preſent Conjunctures, for the avoiding all manner of miſ-underſtanding and rupture, which yet happened, by the violent Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made by the Army of <hi>Sweden,</hi> towards the end of the year, 1674. upon <hi>Marchia</hi> and <hi>Pomerania,</hi> directly againſt thoſe, for whom ſuch ſolemn Stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations had been, and contrary to the liberty, which each Party had reſerv'd to themſelves, in the ſaid Alliance: Which Invaſion was the more unjuſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it was made at a time, when his Electoral Serenity, relying on the publick Faith, had ſent his Forces ſo far off, that he was buſie with them in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatia.</hi> The Lords the States condemn'd and diſliked this Proceeding no leſs, than all other Chriſtian Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96323:88"/> throughout <hi>Europe</hi> did; and God has made appear to all the World, by what has enſued, and by our marvellous ſucceſs, that his powerful Hand is able to protect the innocent, and puniſh thoſe that make ſo ſlight of Religion, Alliances, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that have had the ſanction of the publick Faith. Their Hi. and Mi. and all others, without doubt, will agree, that it were an unheard of piece of cruelty, to deal with his Electoral Serenity, as he is threatned in that Memorial, for having made ſo vigorous and glorious an oppoſition, to ſo unjuſt and forcible an Invaſion. The ſaid Ambaſſador does not intend to lay open the weakneſs of the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the ſaid Memorial of the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France,</hi> aſſuring himſelf, that their Hi. and Mi. will not fail to expoſe it to the World, for the refutation of thoſe, that for want of ſolid Reaſons, have been forced to betake themſelves, to ſuch weak and groundleſs Arguments; ſince it appears, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they contradict, and directly thwart, what the Moſt Chriſtian King has avow'd, and poſitively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, by the Letters and Reſolutions, which his Majeſty has cauſed to be diſpatched, and delivered to their Hi. and Mi. and to their Miniſters. He will only repreſent, what wrong would be done to his Electoral Serenity, his Maſter, if their Hi. and Mi. ſhould give ear to ſuch Conditions, as conduce to no other end, but that of ſerving the Intereſt of a declared Enemy, by deſerting a faithful Friend and Ally, and, at the ſame time, expoſing their own Common-wealth, to the moſt dangerous hazard in the World, which they have endeavoured, out of their great prudence, and with ſo much care, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and ſhelter, by means of a Bar in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which the Moſt Chriſtian King himſelf thought
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96323:88"/> neceſſary for maintaining their repoſe, but which will ſtand them in no ſtead, if ſuch another Bar be not likewiſe ſettled upon the Rhine. Certainly, there needs more then an ordinary aſſurance, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the perſwading a whole Common-wealth, conſiſting of ſo many wiſe, and illuſtrious Members, to renounce whatever the Faith of their Alliances, and the true Intereſt of their own Common-wealth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of them, and ſubmit to ſuch prejudicial Councels; and to further the ſuffering an Ally, and Neighbour, to be oppreſſed, that has given ſuch extraordinary proofs of his Friendſhip to their State; and that in favour of a party, with whom at preſent they are engaged in open War, and that expreſſes by his exceſſive demands, ſo little of an inclination to come to ſuch a reconciliation, as may be fair, and at all proportionable to the miſchiefs, and inconveniences, that this fatal War has brought, and continues to bring upon Chriſtendom. I ſhall leave the reſt to the wiſe diſcuſſion of their Hi. and Mi. by reaſon of whoſe fidelity, affection, and Juſtice, his Electoral Serenity is well aſſured, that they will teſtifie in this occurrence, as great a paſſion for the ſecurity, and defence, of his Provinces of <hi>Cleve,</hi> which have always ſerv'd for a Bar; and whoſe preſervation, has always been ſo very dear to them, as his Electoral Serenity has an affection to their Common-wealth upon ſo many occaſions, and of which he has given ſuch remarkable inſtances, eſpecially, ſince the publick Faith, and the Welfare, and ſecurity of their own Eſtate, are equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Intereſt of it.</p>

            <p>THe Ambaſſadors, Plenipotentiaries, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters underwritten, underſtanding, with the utmoſt aſtoniſhment, that there was a likelihood of the Lords Ambaſſadors, of the States General, of the <hi>United Provinces;</hi> reſolving to Sign this day, a ſeparate Treaty of Peace, betwixt the Moſt Chriſtian King, and their Hi. and Mi. which has been likewiſe confirm'd to them, by ſome of the ſaid Ambaſſadors themſelves, though hitherto, they have not made any communication of the Contents of their Project, nor held any particular Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, upon a matter of ſo great conſequence, in conformity to Treaties, by which their Hi. and Mi. are obliged ſo to do.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Ambaſſadors, and Plenipotentiary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, have thought it their duty, to repreſent to the Lords Ambaſſadors, of their Hi. and Mi. the diſagreement of this proceeding, with the Tenour of the Alliances, ſo ſolemnly ſtruck with their Lords and Maſters; wherein the Lords the States, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe upon their Word, and upon the credit of the publick Faith, never to think of making ſeparate Treaties with their common Enemy, that was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point of overturning their Common-wealth,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96323:89"/> and from whoſe oppreſſion, they were ſaved onely by ſuch aſſiſtances, and diverſions, as were given from time to time in divers parts of the Empire, for their ſakes.</p>
            <p>Then they required with all the inſtances ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, and conjur'd the ſaid Lords Ambaſſadors, by what ever is held moſt ſacred, and inviolable, not to precipitate the Signing this ſeparate Peace, being directly oppoſite to the ſaid Alliances, and to allow them a little time, to give their Lords and Maſters neceſſary information: ſince that delay could not be at all prejudicial to them, and that requeſt being but what every one might expect, from the publick Faith, and the ſincerity of the Lords, the States General. They promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the more aſſuredly, that both will be granted without any difficulty, eſpecially, becauſe there ſeems not to be any apparent neceſſity, why their Hi. and Mi. ſhould take up a reſolution, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all that they have taken, and concerted heretofore, and even after they had exhorted their Allies afreſh to ſtedfaſtneſs, in the obſervance, and performance of the Treaties, and after the ſaid Allies, our Lords and Maſters, had taken vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reſolutions thereupon, and in compliance with their deſires, had ſent ſuch numerous Forces into the heart of the <hi>Spaniſh Low-Countreys,</hi> to ſave <hi>Mons</hi> from the extremity, to which the Arms of <hi>France</hi> had reduced it, and to ſecond and execute, what other deſigns, and exploits, <hi>Spain,</hi> and the State, under the conduct of his Highneſs, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> ſhould reſolve upon, for the good of the common cauſe, and the ſafety of the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> in particular.</p>
            <pb n="164" facs="tcp:96323:90"/>
            <p>They have ordered moreover, ſome ſelect Troops, that are now under march, to draw towards the <hi>Muſe,</hi> and to be employ'd for the ſame purpoſe; ſo that with God's aſſiſtance, we have yet reaſon to hope for good ſucceſs, in ſo juſt, and good a Cauſe.</p>
            <p>However, if the Lords the States, ſhould find themſelves obliged, by ſome indiſpenſable neceſſity, (the occaſion and force whereof, is for all that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Allies) to proceed with ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, to a ſeparate Peace with <hi>France;</hi> the ſaid Ambaſſadors, and Miniſters, declare by this Memorial, that their Lords and Maſters, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and ready to enter with them into this Treaty, and to conclude a Peace with his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, in conjunction with the Lords, the States General, upon ſuch honourable, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable Conditions, as ſhall be agreed on, in a ſhort time, towards the concluſion whereof, they will bring all manner of facility, and good offices, on their parts.</p>
            <p>We promiſe our ſelves, that the ſaid Lords Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, will not refuſe ſo juſt and generous an offer; nor can we be perſwaded, that the intention of their Hi. and Mi. is not exactly conformable to this juſt deſire, or that they can ſo much as conceive a thought, of abandoning their good and faithful Friends, Neighbours, and Allies, that have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed what ever was moſt dear, and precious to them in the world, to ſave them from the ruine that threatned them, and to re-eſtabliſh them in their former Liberty, and Splendour. At leaſt, we promiſe our ſelves, from their Juſtice, and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they will not conclude upon any thing, that ſhall not comprehend the Intereſts of their Allies, which in effect are their own, nor joyn in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:96323:90"/> the oppreſſion, and ruine, of thoſe that have ſo faithfully aſſiſted them, againſt ſo powerful an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; who on the one hand, makes ſo much ſhow of the ſincerity of his deſire, to reſtore Peace to Chriſtendom, and on the other, refuſes to admit of ſuch means, as are capable of procuring it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, this abandoning their Allies, and the Neutrality, that they pretend to ſettle, was not ſo much as required by the Moſt Chriſtian King, in the platform of Conditions of Peace, which he Projected; the States, having always declared, againſt accepting the Ceſſation for ſix weeks, which the Moſt Chriſtian-King afterwards offered; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Neutrality, was made a Condition of it, which would have put them out of a poſſibility of aſſiſting their Allies.</p>
            <p>But if the worſt came to the worſt, and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, all theſe juſt and equitable Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, they will proceed to Sign a Treaty of this nature; the ſaid Ambaſſadors, Plenipotentiaries, and Miniſters of the High-Allies, can do no other, then ſolemnly, and moſt formally, to proteſt againſt this ſeparate Treaty, as being directly contrary to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances, and the ſolemn aſſurances, that have been given from time to time, of the ſtedfaſtneſs, and exactneſs, of their Hi. and Mi. in obſerving, and fulfilling their Treaties.</p>
            <p>They challenge them likewiſe for all the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, inconveniences, loſſes, and dammages, that all Chriſtendom in general, and their Lords and Maſters, each in particular, may ſuffer by this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the non-obſervance of Alliances, ſo ſolemnly, and ſacredly contracted, ſaving to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all their right, by vertue of thoſe Alliances, by the Law of Nations, and that of God and Man,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96323:91"/> ſubmitting to the ſound, and diſintereſſed judgment of all the World, the wrong done to their Lords and Maſters, contrary to all promiſes, engagements, Treaties, and that without any neceſſity, by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure equally raſh, and unheard of, in a time when God gives us hopes of redreſs, in a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and reaſonable way; they challenge them, as thoſe, that out of blind paſſions, and prepoſſeſs'd ſentiments, even againſt their opinion, who are animated with a more generous ſenſe of honour, and the conſideration of their own engagements, to a rational ſtedfaſtneſs, ſacrifice the honour, and glory of their party, to proceedings unworthy a State that is governed by reaſon, and Juſtice; by which manner of acting, they contract ſuch a ſtain, as will never wear out of the memory of mankind.</p>

            <p>THE Glory which the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> has always acquired, and maintain'd hitherto, without the leaſt imputation, by its ſtedfaſtneſs and conſtancy, by its fidelity to its Allies, and by its religious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to its Faith, leaves the under-written Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96323:93"/> Plenipotentiaries, and Miniſters of the High Allies, no room to doubt, but that it will yet continue in the ſame generous Sentiments, and tranſmit this Reputation to poſterity, which all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages have been obliged to publiſh in its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>But becauſe, ſince the unforeſeen ſigning of the Peace betwixt <hi>France,</hi> and the Lords the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the moſt glorious opportunity has preſented it ſelf, that ever could have happened, to ſignalize this honourable firmneſs, and purchaſe a new ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and luſtre to the ſaid Monarchy, the ſaid parties under-written would not be wanting to make uſe of it, to repreſent to their Excellencies, the Lords Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of his Catholick Majeſty, at this Congreſs, that their Lords and Maſters can promiſe themſelves no leſs, from the juſtice and equity of theirs, by their former experience, than the like behaviour upon the preſent occaſion; to the end, that all the World may judge with them, that Fidelity is the moſt precious Diadem of a well-ordered State, which no force can invade, no adverſity pervert, no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity bereave it of; and that they juſtly and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly expect to ſee thoſe defects, that rather by the unfortunate conſtitution of Affairs, than out of any ill will, have hitherto intervened, in divers Articles of the Treaties, that are betwixt his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and themſelves, made up by this unſhaken conſtancy; ſo as his Majeſty will not in any ſort ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate or looſen himſelf from thoſe, that have not feared to expoſe themſelves on the very brink of a precipice, and to throw themſelves into the moſt dangerous events, wherein they yet continue, for his ſake, and to draw his Countries, in theſe Parts, out of the gulf that was about to ſwallow them up.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96323:93"/> The ſaid parties under-written can aſſure their ſaid Excellencies, upon their certain knowledge, and by their expreſs Orders, that their Lords and Maſters are entirely diſpoſed, and ready to take part with theirs, and with all thoſe that ſhall now think it their intereſt, or will be willing yet to joyn in the defence of ſo juſt a Cauſe, as the common Cauſe is, and in the eſtabliſhment of the publick ſafety, in all the hazards, perils, and dangerous events, that the Divine Providence ſhall be pleaſed to ordain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the event ſhould fall out to be that of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing ſo juſt a Deſign, by a general, a juſt, and a reaſonable Peace, or whether the Enemy ſhould be ſo hard, as to make the obtaining it, ſtick upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable conditions and demands, and expoſe it to the continuance of a longer and a fiercer War.</p>
            <p>Not any of our Lords and Maſters ever refuſed to take ſuch courſes, as reaſon and decency have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed between Soveraign Princes, to arrive at the firſt; they will yet joyfully embrace them, and will demonſtrate by their readineſs and facility, that the Quiet of Chriſtendom is the only object of all their wiſhes: But ſince it is evident to all the World, that the Enemies have hitherto refuſed to admit of any, but would preſcribe Laws to us, rather than ſuffer us to treat upon terms in order to it, it is eaſily diſcovered not to be their fault, that at preſent we are all involv'd in the latter.</p>
            <p>A rational ſtedfaſtneſs is only capable of redreſſing theſe miſchiefs, and of bringing them back to more juſt and decent Meaſures, that have been led aſide out of the way of their Duty and Engagements, by the ſecret Cabals of ſome private Perſons, and the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96323:94"/> violence and inadvertence of ſome Men of fickle minds, that know not how dear and precious Faith and Truth ought to be to a free State; when they ſhall take notice, that his Majeſty is far from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo pernicious an example, and will keep faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the Letter of the mutual Treaties, out of which your Excellencies will find ſome neceſſary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts hereunto annexed, and let the World ſee, that he chuſeth rather to run the ſame fortune with his Allies to the very laſt, than unmercifully to deſert them, contrary to all ſacredneſs of promiſes, and only to ſave himſelf to their coſt, by a notorious breach of ſuch ſolemn Alliances.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty can loſe nothing by this means, but will be a gainer, by maintaining his Glory, his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and his Reputation. The Bar that is ſetled for bounds to the Conqueſts of <hi>France,</hi> is rather a large career for it, to drive on its Deſigns in, as far as it liſteth. All that is left the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> ſerves rather to exhauſt his Treaſures, for the little time that he ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enjoy it peaceably, than to give him any aſſurance of a ſetled poſſeſſion. And when they ſhall have looſen'd the ſacred Band of the Allies, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed the neighbouring Eſtates, who will hinder the reſt from falling under the dominion of a foreign Power, when-ever the Enemy ſhall have a mind to it? Certainly, they that for their good will, and all their endeavours, and all the hazards to which they have expos'd themſelves, ſhall find themſelves now either evil-entreated by their Friends, or deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Allies, and ſo ill rewarded for their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and good will, will be wiſer at another time, when the fire ſhall be greater, than to run to quench it, and every one will content himſelf to provide for
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96323:94"/> his own ſafety, when he ſhall conſider, how unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily he has been recompenced, for what he has now done for that of the Publick.</p>
            <p>But the ſtrength of all theſe Arguments is ſo well known, to their Excellencies aforeſaid, that it would be ſuperfluous to alledge new ones. They know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, how neceſſary it is, for all that are concern'd in the Intereſt of the preſervation of the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> not to let them utterly ſink, what-ever may be pretended outwardly. The Enemy's Arms have already got too faſt hold of theſe Rampiers, of the neighbouring Eſtates, for us to imagine, that they can be contented to ſee them entirely loſt. For this cauſe the Ambaſſadors, Plenipotentiaries, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters under-written, will not enlarge upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of theſe Matters. They are only bound in duty, to conjure your Excellencies, by the ſacredneſs of reciprocal Engagements, by the force of mutual Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances, by the Faith of the King your Maſter, and by the Glory and the Honour of your Nation and Country, not to make any ſtep on the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that may be prejudicial to their Lords and Maſters, or be injurious to your own, or your ſelves, ſince we are perſwaded, you never will leave this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to the common Enemies, of being ſuperior to the King your Maſter in conſtancy, and ſtedfaſtneſs to their Allies, though Deſtiny may by the fortune of War, have made his condition at preſent ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what worſe than theirs.</p>
            <p>This is what the Parties under-written do moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly beſeech your Excellencies, not only to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your ſelves with mature deliberation, but duely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to report it where 'tis proper, that we may both know, that theſe things have been repreſented in time, and promiſe our ſelves ſuch reſolutions and effects, as
